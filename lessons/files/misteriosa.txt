The tempest raged without\r\n'b'intermission from the 18th to the 26th of March. Its ravages were\r\n'b'terrible in America, Europe, and Asia, covering a distance of eighteen\r\n'b'hundred miles, and extending obliquely to the equator from the\r\n'b'thirty-fifth north parallel to the fortieth south parallel. Towns were\r\n'b'overthrown, forests uprooted, coasts devastated by the mountains of\r\n'b'water which were precipitated on them, vessels cast on the shore, which\r\n'b'the published accounts numbered by hundreds, whole districts leveled\r\n'b'by waterspouts which destroyed everything they passed over, several\r\n'b'thousand people crushed on land or drowned at sea; such were the traces\r\n'b'of its fury, left by this devastating tempest. It surpassed in disasters\r\n'b'those which so frightfully ravaged Havana and Guadalupe, one on the 25th\r\n'b'of October, 1810, the other on the 26th of July, 1825.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But while so many catastrophes were taking place on land and at sea, a\r\n'b'drama not less exciting was being enacted in the agitated air.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, a balloon, as a ball might be carried on the summit of a\r\n'b'waterspout, had been taken into the circling movement of a column of\r\n'b'air and had traversed space at the rate of ninety miles an hour, turning\r\n'b'round and round as if seized by some aerial maelstrom.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Beneath the lower point of the balloon swung a car, containing five\r\n'b'passengers, scarcely visible in the midst of the thick vapor mingled\r\n'b'with spray which hung over the surface of the ocean.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Whence, it may be asked, had come that plaything of the tempest? From\r\n'b'what part of the world did it rise? It surely could not have started\r\n'b'during the storm. But the storm had raged five days already, and the\r\n'b'first symptoms were manifested on the 18th. It cannot be doubted that\r\n'b'the balloon came from a great distance, for it could not have traveled\r\n'b'less than two thousand miles in twenty-four hours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At any rate the passengers, destitute of all marks for their guidance,\r\n'b'could not have possessed the means of reckoning the route traversed\r\n'b'since their departure. It was a remarkable fact that, although in the\r\n'b'very midst of the furious tempest, they did not suffer from it. They\r\n'b'were thrown about and whirled round and round without feeling the\r\n'b'rotation in the slightest degree, or being sensible that they were\r\n'b'removed from a horizontal position.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their eyes could not pierce through the thick mist which had gathered\r\n'b'beneath the car. Dark vapor was all around them. Such was the density\r\n'b'of the atmosphere that they could not be certain whether it was day or\r\n'b'night. No reflection of light, no sound from inhabited land, no roaring\r\n'b'of the ocean could have reached them, through the obscurity, while\r\n'b'suspended in those elevated zones. Their rapid descent alone had\r\n'b'informed them of the dangers which they ran from the waves. However,\r\n'b'the balloon, lightened of heavy articles, such as ammunition, arms, and\r\n'b'provisions, had risen into the higher layers of the atmosphere, to a\r\n'b'height of 4,500 feet. The voyagers, after having discovered that the sea\r\n'b'extended beneath them, and thinking the dangers above less dreadful than\r\n'b'those below, did not hesitate to throw overboard even their most useful\r\n'b'articles, while they endeavored to lose no more of that fluid, the life\r\n'b'of their enterprise, which sustained them above the abyss.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night passed in the midst of alarms which would have been death to\r\n'b'less energetic souls. Again the day appeared and with it the tempest\r\n'b'began to moderate. From the beginning of that day, the 24th of March,\r\n'b'it showed symptoms of abating. At dawn, some of the lighter clouds had\r\n'b'risen into the more lofty regions of the air. In a few hours the wind\r\n'b'had changed from a hurricane to a fresh breeze, that is to say, the rate\r\n'b'of the transit of the atmospheric layers was diminished by half. It\r\n'b'was still what sailors call \xe2\x80\x9ca close-reefed topsail breeze,\xe2\x80\x9d but the\r\n'b'commotion in the elements had none the less considerably diminished.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the lower region of the air was sensibly\r\n'b'clearer. The atmosphere threw off that chilly dampness which is felt\r\n'b'after the passage of a great meteor. The storm did not seem to have gone\r\n'b'farther to the west. It appeared to have exhausted itself. Could it have\r\n'b'passed away in electric sheets, as is sometimes the case with regard to\r\n'b'the typhoons of the Indian Ocean?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But at the same time, it was also evident that the balloon was again\r\n'b'slowly descending with a regular movement. It appeared as if it were,\r\n'b'little by little, collapsing, and that its case was lengthening and\r\n'b'extending, passing from a spherical to an oval form. Towards midday the\r\n'b'balloon was hovering above the sea at a height of only 2,000 feet. It\r\n'b'contained 50,000 cubic feet of gas, and, thanks to its capacity, it\r\n'b'could maintain itself a long time in the air, although it should reach a\r\n'b'great altitude or might be thrown into a horizontal position.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Perceiving their danger, the passengers cast away the last articles\r\n'b'which still weighed down the car, the few provisions they had kept,\r\n'b'everything, even to their pocket-knives, and one of them, having hoisted\r\n'b'himself on to the circles which united the cords of the net, tried to\r\n'b'secure more firmly the lower point of the balloon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was, however, evident to the voyagers that the gas was failing, and\r\n'b'that the balloon could no longer be sustained in the higher regions.\r\n'b'They must infallibly perish!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was not a continent, nor even an island, visible beneath them.\r\n'b'The watery expanse did not present a single speck of land, not a solid\r\n'b'surface upon which their anchor could hold.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the open sea, whose waves were still dashing with tremendous\r\n'b'violence! It was the ocean, without any visible limits, even for those\r\n'b'whose gaze, from their commanding position, extended over a radius of\r\n'b'forty miles. The vast liquid plain, lashed without mercy by the storm,\r\n'b'appeared as if covered with herds of furious chargers, whose white and\r\n'b'disheveled crests were streaming in the wind. No land was in sight, not\r\n'b'a solitary ship could be seen. It was necessary at any cost to arrest\r\n'b'their downward course, and to prevent the balloon from being engulfed in\r\n'b'the waves. The voyagers directed all their energies to this urgent work.\r\n'b'But, notwithstanding their efforts, the balloon still fell, and at the\r\n'b'same time shifted with the greatest rapidity, following the direction of\r\n'b'the wind, that is to say, from the northeast to the southwest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Frightful indeed was the situation of these unfortunate men. They were\r\n'b'evidently no longer masters of the machine. All their attempts were\r\n'b'useless. The case of the balloon collapsed more and more. The gas\r\n'b'escaped without any possibility of retaining it. Their descent was\r\n'b'visibly accelerated, and soon after midday the car hung within 600 feet\r\n'b'of the ocean.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was impossible to prevent the escape of gas, which rushed through a\r\n'b'large rent in the silk. By lightening the car of all the articles which\r\n'b'it contained, the passengers had been able to prolong their suspension\r\n'b'in the air for a few hours. But the inevitable catastrophe could only\r\n'b'be retarded, and if land did not appear before night, voyagers, car, and\r\n'b'balloon must to a certainty vanish beneath the waves.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They now resorted to the only remaining expedient. They were truly\r\n'b'dauntless men, who knew how to look death in the face. Not a single\r\n'b'murmur escaped from their lips. They were determined to struggle to the\r\n'b'last minute, to do anything to retard their fall. The car was only a\r\n'b'sort of willow basket, unable to float, and there was not the slightest\r\n'b'possibility of maintaining it on the surface of the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two more hours passed and the balloon was scarcely 400 feet above the\r\n'b'water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment a loud voice, the voice of a man whose heart was\r\n'b'inaccessible to fear, was heard. To this voice responded others not\r\n'b'less determined. \xe2\x80\x9cIs everything thrown out?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNo, here are still 2,000\r\n'b'dollars in gold.\xe2\x80\x9d A heavy bag immediately plunged into the sea. \xe2\x80\x9cDoes\r\n'b'the balloon rise?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cA little, but it will not be long before it falls\r\n'b'again.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cWhat still remains to be thrown out?\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cNothing.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYes! the\r\n'b'car!\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cLet us catch hold of the net, and into the sea with the car.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was, in fact, the last and only mode of lightening the balloon.\r\n'b'The ropes which held the car were cut, and the balloon, after its fall,\r\n'b'mounted 2,000 feet. The five voyagers had hoisted themselves into the\r\n'b'net, and clung to the meshes, gazing at the abyss.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The delicate sensibility of balloons is well known. It is sufficient to\r\n'b'throw out the lightest article to produce a difference in its vertical\r\n'b'position. The apparatus in the air is like a balance of mathematical\r\n'b'precision. It can be thus easily understood that when it is lightened of\r\n'b'any considerable weight its movement will be impetuous and sudden. So\r\n'b'it happened on this occasion. But after being suspended for an instant\r\n'b'aloft, the balloon began to redescend, the gas escaping by the rent\r\n'b'which it was impossible to repair.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The men had done all that men could do. No human efforts could save them\r\n'b'now.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They must trust to the mercy of Him who rules the elements.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the balloon was only 500 feet above the surface of the\r\n'b'water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A loud barking was heard. A dog accompanied the voyagers, and was held\r\n'b'pressed close to his master in the meshes of the net.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop has seen something,\xe2\x80\x9d cried one of the men. Then immediately a loud\r\n'b'voice shouted,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLand! land!\xe2\x80\x9d The balloon, which the wind still drove towards the\r\n'b'southwest, had since daybreak gone a considerable distance, which might\r\n'b'be reckoned by hundreds of miles, and a tolerably high land had, in\r\n'b'fact, appeared in that direction. But this land was still thirty miles\r\n'b'off. It would not take less than an hour to get to it, and then there\r\n'b'was the chance of falling to leeward.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An hour! Might not the balloon before that be emptied of all the fluid\r\n'b'it yet retained?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Such was the terrible question! The voyagers could distinctly see that\r\n'b'solid spot which they must reach at any cost. They were ignorant of what\r\n'b'it was, whether an island or a continent, for they did not know to what\r\n'b'part of the world the hurricane had driven them. But they must reach\r\n'b'this land, whether inhabited or desolate, whether hospitable or not.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was evident that the balloon could no longer support itself! Several\r\n'b'times already had the crests of the enormous billows licked the bottom\r\n'b'of the net, making it still heavier, and the balloon only half rose,\r\n'b'like a bird with a wounded wing. Half an hour later the land was not\r\n'b'more than a mile off, but the balloon, exhausted, flabby, hanging in\r\n'b'great folds, had gas in its upper part alone. The voyagers, clinging to\r\n'b'the net, were still too heavy for it, and soon, half plunged into the\r\n'b'sea, they were beaten by the furious waves. The balloon-case bulged out\r\n'b'again, and the wind, taking it, drove it along like a vessel. Might it\r\n'b'not possibly thus reach the land?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But, when only two fathoms off, terrible cries resounded from four pairs\r\n'b'of lungs at once. The balloon, which had appeared as if it would never\r\n'b'again rise, suddenly made an unexpected bound, after having been struck\r\n'b'by a tremendous sea. As if it had been at that instant relieved of a new\r\n'b'part of its weight, it mounted to a height of 1,500 feet, and here it\r\n'b'met a current of wind, which instead of taking it directly to the coast,\r\n'b'carried it in a nearly parallel direction.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last, two minutes later, it reproached obliquely, and finally fell on\r\n'b'a sandy beach, out of the reach of the waves.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The voyagers, aiding each other, managed to disengage themselves from\r\n'b'the meshes of the net. The balloon, relieved of their weight, was taken\r\n'b'by the wind, and like a wounded bird which revives for an instant,\r\n'b'disappeared into space.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the car had contained five passengers, with a dog, and the balloon\r\n'b'only left four on the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The missing person had evidently been swept off by the sea, which had\r\n'b'just struck the net, and it was owing to this circumstance that the\r\n'b'lightened balloon rose the last time, and then soon after reached the\r\n'b'land. Scarcely had the four castaways set foot on firm ground, than they\r\n'b'all, thinking of the absent one, simultaneously exclaimed, \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he\r\n'b'will try to swim to land! Let us save him! let us save him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 2\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Those whom the hurricane had just thrown on this coast were neither\r\n'b'aeronauts by profession nor amateurs. They were prisoners of war whose\r\n'b'boldness had induced them to escape in this extraordinary manner.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A hundred times they had almost perished! A hundred times had they\r\n'b'almost fallen from their torn balloon into the depths of the ocean. But\r\n'b'Heaven had reserved them for a strange destiny, and after having, on the\r\n'b'20th of March, escaped from Richmond, besieged by the troops of General\r\n'b'Ulysses Grant, they found themselves seven thousand miles from the\r\n'b'capital of Virginia, which was the principal stronghold of the South,\r\n'b'during the terrible War of Secession. Their aerial voyage had lasted\r\n'b'five days.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The curious circumstances which led to the escape of the prisoners were\r\n'b'as follows:\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That same year, in the month of February, 1865, in one of the coups\r\n'b'de main by which General Grant attempted, though in vain, to possess\r\n'b'himself of Richmond, several of his officers fell into the power of the\r\n'b'enemy and were detained in the town. One of the most distinguished was\r\n'b'Captain Cyrus Harding. He was a native of Massachusetts, a first-class\r\n'b'engineer, to whom the government had confided, during the war, the\r\n'b'direction of the railways, which were so important at that time. A\r\n'b'true Northerner, thin, bony, lean, about forty-five years of age; his\r\n'b'close-cut hair and his beard, of which he only kept a thick mustache,\r\n'b'were already getting gray. He had one-of those finely-developed heads\r\n'b'which appear made to be struck on a medal, piercing eyes, a serious\r\n'b'mouth, the physiognomy of a clever man of the military school. He was\r\n'b'one of those engineers who began by handling the hammer and pickaxe,\r\n'b'like generals who first act as common soldiers. Besides mental power, he\r\n'b'also possessed great manual dexterity. His muscles exhibited remarkable\r\n'b'proofs of tenacity. A man of action as well as a man of thought, all he\r\n'b'did was without effort to one of his vigorous and sanguine temperament.\r\n'b'Learned, clear-headed, and practical, he fulfilled in all\r\n'b'emergencies those three conditions which united ought to insure human\r\n'b'success--activity of mind and body, impetuous wishes, and powerful will.\r\n'b'He might have taken for his motto that of William of Orange in the 17th\r\n'b'century: \xe2\x80\x9cI can undertake and persevere even without hope of success.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' Cyrus Harding was courage personified. He had been in all the battles of\r\n'b'that war. After having begun as a volunteer at Illinois, under Ulysses\r\n'b'Grant, he fought at Paducah, Belmont, Pittsburg Landing, at the siege of\r\n'b'Corinth, Port Gibson, Black River, Chattanooga, the Wilderness, on the\r\n'b'Potomac, everywhere and valiantly, a soldier worthy of the general who\r\n'b'said, \xe2\x80\x9cI never count my dead!\xe2\x80\x9d And hundreds of times Captain Harding had\r\n'b'almost been among those who were not counted by the terrible Grant; but\r\n'b'in these combats where he never spared himself, fortune favored him till\r\n'b'the moment when he was wounded and taken prisoner on the field of battle\r\n'b'near Richmond. At the same time and on the same day another important\r\n'b'personage fell into the hands of the Southerners. This was no other than\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett, a reporter for the New York Herald, who had been ordered\r\n'b'to follow the changes of the war in the midst of the Northern armies.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett was one of that race of indomitable English or American\r\n'b'chroniclers, like Stanley and others, who stop at nothing to obtain\r\n'b'exact information, and transmit it to their journal in the shortest\r\n'b'possible time. The newspapers of the Union, such as the New York Herald,\r\n'b'are genuine powers, and their reporters are men to be reckoned with.\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett ranked among the first of those reporters: a man of great\r\n'b'merit, energetic, prompt and ready for anything, full of ideas, having\r\n'b'traveled over the whole world, soldier and artist, enthusiastic in\r\n'b'council, resolute in action, caring neither for trouble, fatigue, nor\r\n'b'danger, when in pursuit of information, for himself first, and then for\r\n'b'his journal, a perfect treasury of knowledge on all sorts of curious\r\n'b'subjects, of the unpublished, of the unknown, and of the impossible. He\r\n'b'was one of those intrepid observers who write under fire, \xe2\x80\x9creporting\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' among bullets, and to whom every danger is welcome.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He also had been in all the battles, in the first rank, revolver in one\r\n'b'hand, note-book in the other; grape-shot never made his pencil tremble.\r\n'b'He did not fatigue the wires with incessant telegrams, like those who\r\n'b'speak when they have nothing to say, but each of his notes, short,\r\n'b'decisive, and clear, threw light on some important point. Besides, he\r\n'b'was not wanting in humor. It was he who, after the affair of the Black\r\n'b'River, determined at any cost to keep his place at the wicket of the\r\n'b'telegraph office, and after having announced to his journal the result\r\n'b'of the battle, telegraphed for two hours the first chapters of the\r\n'b'Bible. It cost the New York Herald two thousand dollars, but the New\r\n'b'York Herald published the first intelligence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett was tall. He was rather more than forty years of age.\r\n'b'Light whiskers bordering on red surrounded his face. His eye was steady,\r\n'b'lively, rapid in its changes. It was the eye of a man accustomed to take\r\n'b'in at a glance all the details of a scene. Well built, he was inured to\r\n'b'all climates, like a bar of steel hardened in cold water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For ten years Gideon Spilett had been the reporter of the New York\r\n'b'Herald, which he enriched by his letters and drawings, for he was as\r\n'b'skilful in the use of the pencil as of the pen. When he was captured,\r\n'b'he was in the act of making a description and sketch of the battle. The\r\n'b'last words in his note-book were these: \xe2\x80\x9cA Southern rifleman has just\r\n'b'taken aim at me, but--\xe2\x80\x9d The Southerner notwithstanding missed Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, who, with his usual fortune, came out of this affair without a\r\n'b'scratch.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, who did not know each other except\r\n'b'by reputation, had both been carried to Richmond. The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'wounds rapidly healed, and it was during his convalescence that he made\r\n'b'acquaintance with the reporter. The two men then learned to appreciate\r\n'b'each other. Soon their common aim had but one object, that of escaping,\r\n'b'rejoining Grant\xe2\x80\x99s army, and fighting together in the ranks of the\r\n'b'Federals.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The two Americans had from the first determined to seize every chance;\r\n'b'but although they were allowed to wander at liberty in the town,\r\n'b'Richmond was so strictly guarded, that escape appeared impossible. In\r\n'b'the meanwhile Captain Harding was rejoined by a servant who was devoted\r\n'b'to him in life and in death. This intrepid fellow was a Negro born on\r\n'b'the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s estate, of a slave father and mother, but to whom Cyrus,\r\n'b'who was an Abolitionist from conviction and heart, had long since given\r\n'b'his freedom. The once slave, though free, would not leave his master. He\r\n'b'would have died for him. He was a man of about thirty, vigorous, active,\r\n'b'clever, intelligent, gentle, and calm, sometimes naive, always merry,\r\n'b'obliging, and honest. His name was Nebuchadnezzar, but he only answered\r\n'b'to the familiar abbreviation of Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When Neb heard that his master had been made prisoner, he left\r\n'b'Massachusetts without hesitating an instant, arrived before Richmond,\r\n'b'and by dint of stratagem and shrewdness, after having risked his life\r\n'b'twenty times over, managed to penetrate into the besieged town. The\r\n'b'pleasure of Harding on seeing his servant, and the joy of Neb at finding\r\n'b'his master, can scarcely be described.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But though Neb had been able to make his way into Richmond, it was quite\r\n'b'another thing to get out again, for the Northern prisoners were very\r\n'b'strictly watched. Some extraordinary opportunity was needed to make the\r\n'b'attempt with any chance of success, and this opportunity not only did\r\n'b'not present itself, but was very difficult to find.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile Grant continued his energetic operations. The victory of\r\n'b'Petersburg had been very dearly bought. His forces, united to those of\r\n'b'Butler, had as yet been unsuccessful before Richmond, and nothing gave\r\n'b'the prisoners any hope of a speedy deliverance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter, to whom his tedious captivity did not offer a single\r\n'b'incident worthy of note, could stand it no longer. His usually active\r\n'b'mind was occupied with one sole thought--how he might get out of\r\n'b'Richmond at any cost. Several times had he even made the attempt,\r\n'b'but was stopped by some insurmountable obstacle. However, the siege\r\n'b'continued; and if the prisoners were anxious to escape and join Grant\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'army, certain of the besieged were no less anxious to join the Southern\r\n'b'forces. Among them was one Jonathan Forster, a determined Southerner.\r\n'b'The truth was, that if the prisoners of the Secessionists could not\r\n'b'leave the town, neither could the Secessionists themselves while the\r\n'b'Northern army invested it. The Governor of Richmond for a long time had\r\n'b'been unable to communicate with General Lee, and he very much wished to\r\n'b'make known to him the situation of the town, so as to hasten the march\r\n'b'of the army to their relief. Thus Jonathan Forster accordingly conceived\r\n'b'the idea of rising in a balloon, so as to pass over the besieging lines,\r\n'b'and in that way reach the Secessionist camp.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The Governor authorized the attempt. A balloon was manufactured and\r\n'b'placed at the disposal of Forster, who was to be accompanied by five\r\n'b'other persons. They were furnished with arms in case they might have\r\n'b'to defend themselves when they alighted, and provisions in the event of\r\n'b'their aerial voyage being prolonged.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The departure of the balloon was fixed for the 18th of March. It should\r\n'b'be effected during the night, with a northwest wind of moderate force,\r\n'b'and the aeronauts calculated that they would reach General Lee\xe2\x80\x99s camp in\r\n'b'a few hours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But this northwest wind was not a simple breeze. From the 18th it was\r\n'b'evident that it was changing to a hurricane. The tempest soon became\r\n'b'such that Forster\xe2\x80\x99s departure was deferred, for it was impossible to\r\n'b'risk the balloon and those whom it carried in the midst of the furious\r\n'b'elements.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The balloon, inflated on the great square of Richmond, was ready to\r\n'b'depart on the first abatement of the wind, and, as may be supposed, the\r\n'b'impatience among the besieged to see the storm moderate was very great.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The 18th, the 19th of March passed without any alteration in the\r\n'b'weather. There was even great difficulty in keeping the balloon fastened\r\n'b'to the ground, as the squalls dashed it furiously about.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night of the 19th passed, but the next morning the storm blew with\r\n'b'redoubled force. The departure of the balloon was impossible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On that day the engineer, Cyrus Harding, was accosted in one of the\r\n'b'streets of Richmond by a person whom he did not in the least know. This\r\n'b'was a sailor named Pencroft, a man of about thirty-five or forty years\r\n'b'of age, strongly built, very sunburnt, and possessed of a pair of\r\n'b'bright sparkling eyes and a remarkably good physiognomy. Pencroft was an\r\n'b'American from the North, who had sailed all the ocean over, and who had\r\n'b'gone through every possible and almost impossible adventure that a being\r\n'b'with two feet and no wings would encounter. It is needless to say that\r\n'b'he was a bold, dashing fellow, ready to dare anything and was astonished\r\n'b'at nothing. Pencroft at the beginning of the year had gone to Richmond\r\n'b'on business, with a young boy of fifteen from New Jersey, son of a\r\n'b'former captain, an orphan, whom he loved as if he had been his\r\n'b'own child. Not having been able to leave the town before the first\r\n'b'operations of the siege, he found himself shut up, to his great disgust;\r\n'b'but, not accustomed to succumb to difficulties, he resolved to escape by\r\n'b'some means or other. He knew the engineer-officer by reputation; he knew\r\n'b'with what impatience that determined man chafed under his restraint. On\r\n'b'this day he did not, therefore, hesitate to accost him, saying, without\r\n'b'circumlocution, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you had enough of Richmond, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer looked fixedly at the man who spoke, and who added, in a\r\n'b'low voice,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding, will you try to escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer quickly, and it was evident that this\r\n'b'question was uttered without consideration, for he had not yet examined\r\n'b'the stranger who addressed him. But after having with a penetrating\r\n'b'eye observed the open face of the sailor, he was convinced that he had\r\n'b'before him an honest man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked briefly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft made himself known.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand in what way do you propose to escape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy that lazy balloon which is left there doing nothing, and which looks\r\n'b'to me as if it was waiting on purpose for us--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no necessity for the sailor to finish his sentence. The\r\n'b'engineer understood him at once. He seized Pencroft by the arm, and\r\n'b'dragged him to his house. There the sailor developed his project, which\r\n'b'was indeed extremely simple. They risked nothing but their lives in its\r\n'b'execution. The hurricane was in all its violence, it is true, but so\r\n'b'clever and daring an engineer as Cyrus Harding knew perfectly well how\r\n'b'to manage a balloon. Had he himself been as well acquainted with the art\r\n'b'of sailing in the air as he was with the navigation of a ship, Pencroft\r\n'b'would not have hesitated to set out, of course taking his young friend\r\n'b'Herbert with him; for, accustomed to brave the fiercest tempests of the\r\n'b'ocean, he was not to be hindered on account of the hurricane.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Harding had listened to the sailor without saying a word,\r\n'b'but his eyes shone with satisfaction. Here was the long-sought-for\r\n'b'opportunity--he was not a man to let it pass. The plan was feasible,\r\n'b'though, it must be confessed, dangerous in the extreme. In the night,\r\n'b'in spite of their guards, they might approach the balloon, slip into the\r\n'b'car, and then cut the cords which held it. There was no doubt that they\r\n'b'might be killed, but on the other hand they might succeed, and without\r\n'b'this storm!--Without this storm the balloon would have started already\r\n'b'and the looked-for opportunity would not have then presented itself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not alone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding at last.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow many people do you wish to bring with you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTwo; my friend Spilett, and my servant Neb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be three,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cand with Herbert and me five.\r\n'b'But the balloon will hold six--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be enough, we will go,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding in a firm voice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x9d included Spilett, for the reporter, as his friend well knew,\r\n'b'was not a man to draw back, and when the project was communicated to him\r\n'b'he approved of it unreservedly. What astonished him was, that so simple\r\n'b'an idea had not occurred to him before. As to Neb, he followed his\r\n'b'master wherever his master wished to go.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will all meet out there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis evening, at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Captain Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cand Heaven\r\n'b'grant that the storm does not abate before our departure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft took leave of the two friends, and returned to his lodging,\r\n'b'where young Herbert Brown had remained. The courageous boy knew of the\r\n'b'sailor\xe2\x80\x99s plan, and it was not without anxiety that he awaited the result\r\n'b'of the proposal being made to the engineer. Thus five determined\r\n'b'persons were about to abandon themselves to the mercy of the tempestuous\r\n'b'elements!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No! the storm did not abate, and neither Jonathan Forster nor his\r\n'b'companions dreamed of confronting it in that frail car.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It would be a terrible journey. The engineer only feared one thing; it\r\n'b'was that the balloon, held to the ground and dashed about by the\r\n'b'wind, would be torn into shreds. For several hours he roamed round the\r\n'b'nearly-deserted square, surveying the apparatus. Pencroft did the same\r\n'b'on his side, his hands in his pockets, yawning now and then like a man\r\n'b'who did not know how to kill the time, but really dreading, like\r\n'b'his friend, either the escape or destruction of the balloon. Evening\r\n'b'arrived. The night was dark in the extreme. Thick mists passed like\r\n'b'clouds close to the ground. Rain fell mingled with snow, it was very\r\n'b'cold. A mist hung over Richmond. It seemed as if the violent storm had\r\n'b'produced a truce between the besiegers and the besieged, and that the\r\n'b'cannon were silenced by the louder detonations of the storm. The streets\r\n'b'of the town were deserted. It had not even appeared necessary in that\r\n'b'horrible weather to place a guard in the square, in the midst of which\r\n'b'plunged the balloon. Everything favored the departure of the prisoners,\r\n'b'but what might possibly be the termination of the hazardous voyage they\r\n'b'contemplated in the midst of the furious elements?--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDirty weather!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, fixing his hat firmly on his head\r\n'b'with a blow of his fist; \xe2\x80\x9cbut pshaw, we shall succeed all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At half-past nine, Harding and his companions glided from different\r\n'b'directions into the square, which the gas-lamps, extinguished by the\r\n'b'wind, had left in total obscurity. Even the enormous balloon, almost\r\n'b'beaten to the ground, could not be seen. Independently of the sacks of\r\n'b'ballast, to which the cords of the net were fastened, the car was\r\n'b'held by a strong cable passed through a ring in the pavement. The five\r\n'b'prisoners met by the car. They had not been perceived, and such was the\r\n'b'darkness that they could not even see each other.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Without speaking a word, Harding, Spilett, Neb, and Herbert took their\r\n'b'places in the car, while Pencroft by the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s order detached\r\n'b'successively the bags of ballast. It was the work of a few minutes only,\r\n'b'and the sailor rejoined his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The balloon was then only held by the cable, and the engineer had\r\n'b'nothing to do but to give the word.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment a dog sprang with a bound into the car. It was Top,\r\n'b'a favorite of the engineer. The faithful creature, having broken his\r\n'b'chain, had followed his master. He, however, fearing that its additional\r\n'b'weight might impede their ascent, wished to send away the animal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne more will make but little difference, poor beast!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\n'b'Pencroft, heaving out two bags of sand, and as he spoke letting go the\r\n'b'cable; the balloon ascending in an oblique direction, disappeared, after\r\n'b'having dashed the car against two chimneys, which it threw down as it\r\n'b'swept by them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, indeed, the full rage of the hurricane was exhibited to the\r\n'b'voyagers. During the night the engineer could not dream of descending,\r\n'b'and when day broke, even a glimpse of the earth below was intercepted by\r\n'b'fog.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Five days had passed when a partial clearing allowed them to see the\r\n'b'wide extending ocean beneath their feet, now lashed into the maddest\r\n'b'fury by the gale.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Our readers will recollect what befell these five daring individuals\r\n'b'who set out on their hazardous expedition in the balloon on the 20th of\r\n'b'March. Five days afterwards four of them were thrown on a desert coast,\r\n'b'seven thousand miles from their country! But one of their number was\r\n'b'missing, the man who was to be their guide, their leading spirit, the\r\n'b'engineer, Captain Harding! The instant they had recovered their feet,\r\n'b'they all hurried to the beach in the hopes of rendering him assistance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 3\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer, the meshes of the net having given way, had been carried\r\n'b'off by a wave. His dog also had disappeared. The faithful animal\r\n'b'had voluntarily leaped out to help his master. \xe2\x80\x9cForward,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\n'b'reporter; and all four, Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb, forgetting\r\n'b'their fatigue, began their search. Poor Neb shed bitter tears, giving\r\n'b'way to despair at the thought of having lost the only being he loved on\r\n'b'earth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Only two minutes had passed from the time when Cyrus Harding disappeared\r\n'b'to the moment when his companions set foot on the ground. They had hopes\r\n'b'therefore of arriving in time to save him. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us look for him! let us\r\n'b'look for him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will find him too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLiving, I trust!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStill living!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCan he swim?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cand besides, Top is there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor, observing the heavy surf on the shore, shook his head.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer had disappeared to the north of the shore, and nearly half\r\n'b'a mile from the place where the castaways had landed. The nearest point\r\n'b'of the beach he could reach was thus fully that distance off.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was then nearly six o\xe2\x80\x99clock. A thick fog made the night very dark.\r\n'b'The castaways proceeded toward the north of the land on which chance had\r\n'b'thrown them, an unknown region, the geographical situation of which they\r\n'b'could not even guess. They were walking upon a sandy soil, mingled with\r\n'b'stones, which appeared destitute of any sort of vegetation. The ground,\r\n'b'very unequal and rough, was in some places perfectly riddled with holes,\r\n'b'making walking extremely painful. From these holes escaped every minute\r\n'b'great birds of clumsy flight, which flew in all directions. Others, more\r\n'b'active, rose in flocks and passed in clouds over their heads. The sailor\r\n'b'thought he recognized gulls and cormorants, whose shrill cries rose\r\n'b'above the roaring of the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From time to time the castaways stopped and shouted, then listened for\r\n'b'some response from the ocean, for they thought that if the engineer had\r\n'b'landed, and they had been near to the place, they would have heard the\r\n'b'barking of the dog Top, even should Harding himself have been unable to\r\n'b'give any sign of existence. They stopped to listen, but no sound arose\r\n'b'above the roaring of the waves and the dashing of the surf. The little\r\n'b'band then continued their march forward, searching into every hollow of\r\n'b'the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After walking for twenty minutes, the four castaways were suddenly\r\n'b'brought to a standstill by the sight of foaming billows close to\r\n'b'their feet. The solid ground ended here. They found themselves at the\r\n'b'extremity of a sharp point on which the sea broke furiously.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a promontory,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cwe must retrace our steps,\r\n'b'holding towards the right, and we shall thus gain the mainland.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut if he is there,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, pointing to the ocean, whose waves shone\r\n'b'of a snowy white in the darkness. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, let us call again,\xe2\x80\x9d and all\r\n'b'uniting their voices, they gave a vigorous shout, but there came no\r\n'b'reply. They waited for a lull, then began again; still no reply.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The castaways accordingly returned, following the opposite side of the\r\n'b'promontory, over a soil equally sandy and rugged. However, Pencroft\r\n'b'observed that the shore was more equal, that the ground rose, and he\r\n'b'declared that it was joined by a long slope to a hill, whose massive\r\n'b'front he thought that he could see looming indistinctly through the\r\n'b'mist. The birds were less numerous on this part of the shore; the sea\r\n'b'was also less tumultuous, and they observed that the agitation of the\r\n'b'waves was diminished. The noise of the surf was scarcely heard. This\r\n'b'side of the promontory evidently formed a semicircular bay, which the\r\n'b'sharp point sheltered from the breakers of the open sea. But to follow\r\n'b'this direction was to go south, exactly opposite to that part of the\r\n'b'coast where Harding might have landed. After a walk of a mile and a\r\n'b'half, the shore presented no curve which would permit them to return to\r\n'b'the north. This promontory, of which they had turned the point, must\r\n'b'be attached to the mainland. The castaways, although their strength\r\n'b'was nearly exhausted, still marched courageously forward, hoping every\r\n'b'moment to meet with a sudden angle which would set them in the first\r\n'b'direction. What was their disappointment, when, after trudging nearly\r\n'b'two miles, having reached an elevated point composed of slippery rocks,\r\n'b'they found themselves again stopped by the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are on an islet,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand we have surveyed it from one\r\n'b'extremity to the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor was right; they had been thrown, not on a continent, not\r\n'b'even on an island, but on an islet which was not more than two miles in\r\n'b'length, with even a less breadth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Was this barren spot the desolate refuge of sea-birds, strewn with\r\n'b'stones and destitute of vegetation, attached to a more important\r\n'b'archipelago? It was impossible to say. When the voyagers from their car\r\n'b'saw the land through the mist, they had not been able to reconnoiter\r\n'b'it sufficiently. However, Pencroft, accustomed with his sailor eyes\r\n'b'to piece through the gloom, was almost certain that he could clearly\r\n'b'distinguish in the west confused masses which indicated an elevated\r\n'b'coast. But they could not in the dark determine whether it was a single\r\n'b'island, or connected with others. They could not leave it either, as the\r\n'b'sea surrounded them; they must therefore put off till the next day their\r\n'b'search for the engineer, from whom, alas! not a single cry had reached\r\n'b'them to show that he was still in existence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe silence of our friend proves nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps\r\n'b'he has fainted or is wounded, and unable to reply directly, so we will\r\n'b'not despair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter then proposed to light a fire on a point of the islet,\r\n'b'which would serve as a signal to the engineer. But they searched in vain\r\n'b'for wood or dry brambles; nothing but sand and stones were to be found.\r\n'b'The grief of Neb and his companions, who were all strongly attached to\r\n'b'the intrepid Harding, can be better pictured than described. It was too\r\n'b'evident that they were powerless to help him. They must wait with what\r\n'b'patience they could for daylight. Either the engineer had been able to\r\n'b'save himself, and had already found a refuge on some point of the coast,\r\n'b'or he was lost for ever! The long and painful hours passed by. The cold\r\n'b'was intense. The castaways suffered cruelly, but they scarcely perceived\r\n'b'it. They did not even think of taking a minute\xe2\x80\x99s rest. Forgetting\r\n'b'everything but their chief, hoping or wishing to hope on, they continued\r\n'b'to walk up and down on this sterile spot, always returning to its\r\n'b'northern point, where they could approach nearest to the scene of the\r\n'b'catastrophe. They listened, they called, and then uniting their voices,\r\n'b'they endeavored to raise even a louder shout than before, which would\r\n'b'be transmitted to a great distance. The wind had now fallen almost to\r\n'b'a calm, and the noise of the sea began also to subside. One of Neb\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'shouts even appeared to produce an echo. Herbert directed Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'attention to it, adding, \xe2\x80\x9cThat proves that there is a coast to the west,\r\n'b'at no great distance.\xe2\x80\x9d The sailor nodded; besides, his eyes could not\r\n'b'deceive him. If he had discovered land, however indistinct it might\r\n'b'appear, land was sure to be there. But that distant echo was the only\r\n'b'response produced by Neb\xe2\x80\x99s shouts, while a heavy gloom hung over all the\r\n'b'part east of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, the sky was clearing little by little. Towards midnight the\r\n'b'stars shone out, and if the engineer had been there with his companions\r\n'b'he would have remarked that these stars did not belong to the Northern\r\n'b'Hemisphere. The Polar Star was not visible, the constellations were not\r\n'b'those which they had been accustomed to see in the United States; the\r\n'b'Southern Cross glittered brightly in the sky.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night passed away. Towards five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning of the 25th\r\n'b'of March, the sky began to lighten; the horizon still remained dark,\r\n'b'but with daybreak a thick mist rose from the sea, so that the eye could\r\n'b'scarcely penetrate beyond twenty feet or so from where they stood. At\r\n'b'length the fog gradually unrolled itself in great heavily moving waves.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was unfortunate, however, that the castaways could distinguish\r\n'b'nothing around them. While the gaze of the reporter and Neb were cast\r\n'b'upon the ocean, the sailor and Herbert looked eagerly for the coast\r\n'b'in the west. But not a speck of land was visible. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\n'b'Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthough I do not see the land, I feel it... it is there...\r\n'b'there... as sure as the fact that we are no longer at Richmond.\xe2\x80\x9d But the\r\n'b'fog was not long in rising. It was only a fine-weather mist. A hot\r\n'b'sun soon penetrated to the surface of the island. About half-past\r\n'b'six, three-quarters of an hour after sunrise, the mist became more\r\n'b'transparent. It grew thicker above, but cleared away below. Soon the\r\n'b'isle appeared as if it had descended from a cloud, then the sea showed\r\n'b'itself around them, spreading far away towards the east, but bounded on\r\n'b'the west by an abrupt and precipitous coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Yes! the land was there. Their safety was at least provisionally\r\n'b'insured. The islet and the coast were separated by a channel about half\r\n'b'a mile in breadth, through which rushed an extremely rapid current.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, one of the castaways, following the impulse of his heart,\r\n'b'immediately threw himself into the current, without consulting his\r\n'b'companions, without saying a single word. It was Neb. He was in haste\r\n'b'to be on the other side, and to climb towards the north. It had been\r\n'b'impossible to hold him back. Pencroft called him in vain. The reporter\r\n'b'prepared to follow him, but Pencroft stopped him. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you want to cross\r\n'b'the channel?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked. \xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\n'b'seaman; \xe2\x80\x9cwait a bit; Neb is well able to carry help to his master. If we\r\n'b'venture into the channel, we risk being carried into the open sea by\r\n'b'the current, which is running very strong; but, if I\xe2\x80\x99m not wrong, it is\r\n'b'ebbing. See, the tide is going down over the sand. Let us have patience,\r\n'b'and at low water it is possible we may find a fordable passage.\xe2\x80\x9d \xe2\x80\x9cYou\r\n'b'are right,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not separate more than we can\r\n'b'help.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this time Neb was struggling vigorously against the current. He\r\n'b'was crossing in an oblique direction. His black shoulders could be seen\r\n'b'emerging at each stroke. He was carried down very quickly, but he also\r\n'b'made way towards the shore. It took more than half an hour to cross from\r\n'b'the islet to the land, and he reached the shore several hundred feet\r\n'b'from the place which was opposite to the point from which he had\r\n'b'started.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Landing at the foot of a high wall of granite, he shook himself\r\n'b'vigorously; and then, setting off running, soon disappeared behind\r\n'b'a rocky point, which projected to nearly the height of the northern\r\n'b'extremity of the islet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb\xe2\x80\x99s companions had watched his daring attempt with painful anxiety,\r\n'b'and when he was out of sight, they fixed their attention on the land\r\n'b'where their hope of safety lay, while eating some shell-fish with which\r\n'b'the sand was strewn. It was a wretched repast, but still it was better\r\n'b'than nothing. The opposite coast formed one vast bay, terminating on the\r\n'b'south by a very sharp point, which was destitute of all vegetation,\r\n'b'and was of a very wild aspect. This point abutted on the shore in a\r\n'b'grotesque outline of high granite rocks. Towards the north, on the\r\n'b'contrary, the bay widened, and a more rounded coast appeared, trending\r\n'b'from the southwest to the northeast, and terminating in a slender cape.\r\n'b'The distance between these two extremities, which made the bow of the\r\n'b'bay, was about eight miles. Half a mile from the shore rose the islet,\r\n'b'which somewhat resembled the carcass of a gigantic whale. Its extreme\r\n'b'breadth was not more than a quarter of a mile.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Opposite the islet, the beach consisted first of sand, covered with\r\n'b'black stones, which were now appearing little by little above the\r\n'b'retreating tide. The second level was separated by a perpendicular\r\n'b'granite cliff, terminated at the top by an unequal edge at a height of\r\n'b'at least 300 feet. It continued thus for a length of three miles, ending\r\n'b'suddenly on the right with a precipice which looked as if cut by the\r\n'b'hand of man. On the left, above the promontory, this irregular and\r\n'b'jagged cliff descended by a long slope of conglomerated rocks till it\r\n'b'mingled with the ground of the southern point. On the upper plateau of\r\n'b'the coast not a tree appeared. It was a flat tableland like that above\r\n'b'Cape Town at the Cape of Good Hope, but of reduced proportions; at least\r\n'b'so it appeared seen from the islet. However, verdure was not wanting to\r\n'b'the right beyond the precipice. They could easily distinguish a confused\r\n'b'mass of great trees, which extended beyond the limits of their view.\r\n'b'This verdure relieved the eye, so long wearied by the continued ranges\r\n'b'of granite. Lastly, beyond and above the plateau, in a northwesterly\r\n'b'direction and at a distance of at least seven miles, glittered a white\r\n'b'summit which reflected the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays. It was that of a lofty mountain,\r\n'b'capped with snow.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The question could not at present be decided whether this land formed\r\n'b'an island, or whether it belonged to a continent. But on beholding\r\n'b'the convulsed masses heaped up on the left, no geologist would have\r\n'b'hesitated to give them a volcanic origin, for they were unquestionably\r\n'b'the work of subterranean convulsions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert attentively examined this land, on\r\n'b'which they might perhaps have to live many long years; on which indeed\r\n'b'they might even die, should it be out of the usual track of vessels, as\r\n'b'was likely to be the case.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you say, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some good and some bad, as in everything,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see. But now the ebb is evidently making. In three hours we\r\n'b'will attempt the passage, and once on the other side, we will try to get\r\n'b'out of this scrape, and I hope may find the captain.\xe2\x80\x9d Pencroft was not\r\n'b'wrong in his anticipations. Three hours later at low tide, the greater\r\n'b'part of the sand forming the bed of the channel was uncovered. Between\r\n'b'the islet and the coast there only remained a narrow channel which would\r\n'b'no doubt be easy to cross.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Gideon Spilett and his companions stripped themselves\r\n'b'of their clothes, which they placed in bundles on their heads, and\r\n'b'then ventured into the water, which was not more than five feet deep.\r\n'b'Herbert, for whom it was too deep, swam like a fish, and got through\r\n'b'capitally. All three arrived without difficulty on the opposite shore.\r\n'b'Quickly drying themselves in the sun, they put on their clothes, which\r\n'b'they had preserved from contact with the water, and sat down to take\r\n'b'counsel together what to do next.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 4\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All at once the reporter sprang up, and telling the sailor that he would\r\n'b'rejoin them at that same place, he climbed the cliff in the direction\r\n'b'which the Negro Neb had taken a few hours before. Anxiety hastened\r\n'b'his steps, for he longed to obtain news of his friend, and he soon\r\n'b'disappeared round an angle of the cliff. Herbert wished to accompany\r\n'b'him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStop here, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cwe have to prepare an encampment,\r\n'b'and to try and find rather better grub than these shell-fish. Our\r\n'b'friends will want something when they come back. There is work for\r\n'b'everybody.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am ready,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cthat will do. We must set about it\r\n'b'regularly. We are tired, cold, and hungry; therefore we must have\r\n'b'shelter, fire, and food. There is wood in the forest, and eggs in nests;\r\n'b'we have only to find a house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cI will look for a cave among the rocks,\r\n'b'and I shall be sure to discover some hole into which we can creep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cgo on, my boy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They both walked to the foot of the enormous wall over the beach, far\r\n'b'from which the tide had now retreated; but instead of going towards the\r\n'b'north, they went southward. Pencroft had remarked, several hundred feet\r\n'b'from the place at which they landed, a narrow cutting, out of which\r\n'b'he thought a river or stream might issue. Now, on the one hand it was\r\n'b'important to settle themselves in the neighborhood of a good stream\r\n'b'of water, and on the other it was possible that the current had thrown\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding on the shore there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cliff, as has been said, rose to a height of three hundred feet, but\r\n'b'the mass was unbroken throughout, and even at its base, scarcely washed\r\n'b'by the sea, it did not offer the smallest fissure which would serve as\r\n'b'a dwelling. It was a perpendicular wall of very hard granite, which even\r\n'b'the waves had not worn away. Towards the summit fluttered myriads of\r\n'b'sea-fowl, and especially those of the web-footed species with long,\r\n'b'flat, pointed beaks--a clamorous tribe, bold in the presence of man,\r\n'b'who probably for the first time thus invaded their domains. Pencroft\r\n'b'recognized the skua and other gulls among them, the voracious little\r\n'b'sea-mew, which in great numbers nestled in the crevices of the granite.\r\n'b'A shot fired among this swarm would have killed a great number, but to\r\n'b'fire a shot a gun was needed, and neither Pencroft nor Herbert had one;\r\n'b'besides this, gulls and sea-mews are scarcely eatable, and even their\r\n'b'eggs have a detestable taste. However, Herbert, who had gone forward\r\n'b'a little more to the left, soon came upon rocks covered with sea-weed,\r\n'b'which, some hours later, would be hidden by the high tide. On these\r\n'b'rocks, in the midst of slippery wrack, abounded bivalve shell-fish, not\r\n'b'to be despised by starving people. Herbert called Pencroft, who ran up\r\n'b'hastily.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere are mussels!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cthese will do instead of eggs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are not mussels,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, who was attentively examining\r\n'b'the molluscs attached to the rocks; \xe2\x80\x9cthey are lithodomes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre they good to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen let us eat some lithodomes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor could rely upon Herbert; the young boy was well up in natural\r\n'b'history, and always had had quite a passion for the science. His father\r\n'b'had encouraged him in it, by letting him attend the lectures of the best\r\n'b'professors in Boston, who were very fond of the intelligent, industrious\r\n'b'lad. And his turn for natural history was, more than once in the course\r\n'b'of time, of great use, and he was not mistaken in this instance. These\r\n'b'lithodomes were oblong shells, suspended in clusters and adhering\r\n'b'very tightly to the rocks. They belong to that species of molluscous\r\n'b'perforators which excavate holes in the hardest stone; their shell is\r\n'b'rounded at both ends, a feature which is not remarked in the common\r\n'b'mussel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Herbert made a good meal of the lithodomes, which were\r\n'b'then half opened to the sun. They ate them as oysters, and as they had\r\n'b'a strong peppery taste, they were palatable without condiments of any\r\n'b'sort.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their hunger was thus appeased for the time, but not their thirst, which\r\n'b'increased after eating these naturally-spiced molluscs. They had then to\r\n'b'find fresh water, and it was not likely that it would be wanting in such\r\n'b'a capriciously uneven region. Pencroft and Herbert, after having taken\r\n'b'the precaution of collecting an ample supply of lithodomes, with which\r\n'b'they filled their pockets and handkerchiefs, regained the foot of the\r\n'b'cliff.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two hundred paces farther they arrived at the cutting, through which, as\r\n'b'Pencroft had guessed, ran a stream of water, whether fresh or not was to\r\n'b'be ascertained. At this place the wall appeared to have been separated\r\n'b'by some violent subterranean force. At its base was hollowed out a\r\n'b'little creek, the farthest part of which formed a tolerably sharp angle.\r\n'b'The watercourse at that part measured one hundred feet in breadth, and\r\n'b'its two banks on each side were scarcely twenty feet high. The river\r\n'b'became strong almost directly between the two walls of granite, which\r\n'b'began to sink above the mouth; it then suddenly turned and disappeared\r\n'b'beneath a wood of stunted trees half a mile off.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the water, and yonder is the wood we require!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Herbert, now we only want the house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The water of the river was limpid. The sailor ascertained that at this\r\n'b'time--that is to say, at low tide, when the rising floods did not reach\r\n'b'it--it was sweet. This important point established, Herbert looked for\r\n'b'some cavity which would serve them as a retreat, but in vain; everywhere\r\n'b'the wall appeared smooth, plain, and perpendicular.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, at the mouth of the watercourse and above the reach of the high\r\n'b'tide, the convulsions of nature had formed, not a grotto, but a pile\r\n'b'of enormous rocks, such as are often met with in granite countries and\r\n'b'which bear the name of \xe2\x80\x9cChimneys.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Herbert penetrated quite far in among the rocks, by sandy\r\n'b'passages in which light was not wanting, for it entered through the\r\n'b'openings which were left between the blocks, of which some were only\r\n'b'sustained by a miracle of equilibrium; but with the light came also\r\n'b'air--a regular corridor-gale--and with the wind the sharp cold from the\r\n'b'exterior. However, the sailor thought that by stopping-up some of\r\n'b'the openings with a mixture of stones and sand, the Chimneys could be\r\n'b'rendered habitable. Their geometrical plan represented the typographical\r\n'b'sign \xe2\x80\x9c&,\xe2\x80\x9d which signifies \xe2\x80\x9cet cetera\xe2\x80\x9d abridged, but by isolating the\r\n'b'upper mouth of the sign, through which the south and west winds blew so\r\n'b'strongly, they could succeed in making the lower part of use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s our work,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand if we ever see Captain Harding\r\n'b'again, he will know how to make something of this labyrinth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see him again, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand when he returns\r\n'b'he must find a tolerable dwelling here. It will be so, if we can make a\r\n'b'fireplace in the left passage and keep an opening for the smoke.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo we can, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand these Chimneys will serve\r\n'b'our turn. Let us set to work, but first come and get a store of fuel. I\r\n'b'think some branches will be very useful in stopping up these openings,\r\n'b'through which the wind shrieks like so many fiends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert and Pencroft left the Chimneys, and, turning the angle, they\r\n'b'began to climb the left bank of the river. The current here was quite\r\n'b'rapid, and drifted down some dead wood. The rising tide--and it could\r\n'b'already be perceived--must drive it back with force to a considerable\r\n'b'distance. The sailor then thought that they could utilize this ebb and\r\n'b'flow for the transport of heavy objects.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After having walked for a quarter of an hour, the sailor and the boy\r\n'b'arrived at the angle which the river made in turning towards the left.\r\n'b'From this point its course was pursued through a forest of magnificent\r\n'b'trees. These trees still retained their verdure, notwithstanding the\r\n'b'advanced season, for they belonged to the family of \xe2\x80\x9cconiferae,\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\n'b'is spread over all the regions of the globe, from northern climates to\r\n'b'the tropics. The young naturalist recognized especially the \xe2\x80\x9cdeedara,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' which are very numerous in the Himalayan zone, and which spread around\r\n'b'them a most agreeable odor. Between these beautiful trees sprang up\r\n'b'clusters of firs, whose opaque open parasol boughs spread wide around.\r\n'b'Among the long grass, Pencroft felt that his feet were crushing dry\r\n'b'branches which crackled like fireworks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cif I don\xe2\x80\x99t know the name of these\r\n'b'trees, at any rate I reckon that we may call them \xe2\x80\x98burning wood,\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n'b'just now that\xe2\x80\x99s the chief thing we want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us get a supply,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, who immediately set to work.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The collection was easily made. It was not even necessary to lop the\r\n'b'trees, for enormous quantities of dead wood were lying at their feet;\r\n'b'but if fuel was not wanting, the means of transporting it was not yet\r\n'b'found. The wood, being very dry, would burn rapidly; it was therefore\r\n'b'necessary to carry to the Chimneys a considerable quantity, and the\r\n'b'loads of two men would not be sufficient. Herbert remarked this.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthere must be some way of carrying\r\n'b'this wood; there is always a way of doing everything. If we had a cart\r\n'b'or a boat, it would be easy enough.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut we have the river,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRight,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cthe river will be to us like a road which\r\n'b'carries of itself, and rafts have not been invented for nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnly,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cat this moment our road is going the wrong\r\n'b'way, for the tide is rising!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be all right if we wait till it ebbs,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cand then we will trust it to carry our fuel to the Chimneys. Let us get\r\n'b'the raft ready.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor, followed by Herbert, directed his steps towards the river.\r\n'b'They both carried, each in proportion to his strength, a load of wood\r\n'b'bound in fagots. They found on the bank also a great quantity of dead\r\n'b'branches in the midst of grass, among which the foot of man had probably\r\n'b'never before trod. Pencroft began directly to make his raft. In a kind\r\n'b'of little bay, created by a point of the shore which broke the current,\r\n'b'the sailor and the lad placed some good-sized pieces of wood, which\r\n'b'they had fastened together with dry creepers. A raft was thus formed, on\r\n'b'which they stacked all they had collected, sufficient, indeed, to have\r\n'b'loaded at least twenty men. In an hour the work was finished, and the\r\n'b'raft moored to the bank, awaited the turning of the tide.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There were still several hours to be occupied, and with one consent\r\n'b'Pencroft and Herbert resolved to gain the upper plateau, so as to have a\r\n'b'more extended view of the surrounding country.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Exactly two hundred feet behind the angle formed by the river, the wall,\r\n'b'terminated by a fall of rocks, died away in a gentle slope to the edge\r\n'b'of the forest. It was a natural staircase. Herbert and the sailor began\r\n'b'their ascent; thanks to the vigor of their muscles they reached the\r\n'b'summit in a few minutes; and proceeded to the point above the mouth of\r\n'b'the river.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On attaining it, their first look was cast upon the ocean which not long\r\n'b'before they had traversed in such a terrible condition. They observed,\r\n'b'with emotion, all that part to the north of the coast on which the\r\n'b'catastrophe had taken place. It was there that Cyrus Harding had\r\n'b'disappeared. They looked to see if some portion of their balloon, to\r\n'b'which a man might possibly cling, yet existed. Nothing! The sea was but\r\n'b'one vast watery desert. As to the coast, it was solitary also. Neither\r\n'b'the reporter nor Neb could be anywhere seen. But it was possible that at\r\n'b'this time they were both too far away to be perceived.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSomething tells me,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat a man as energetic as Captain\r\n'b'Harding would not let himself be drowned like other people. He must have\r\n'b'reached some point of the shore; don\xe2\x80\x99t you think so, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor shook his head sadly. He little expected ever to see Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding again; but wishing to leave some hope to Herbert: \xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\r\n'b'doubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cour engineer is a man who would get out of a\r\n'b'scrape to which any one else would yield.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meantime he examined the coast with great attention. Stretched\r\n'b'out below them was the sandy shore, bounded on the right of the river\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'mouth by lines of breakers. The rocks which were visible appeared like\r\n'b'amphibious monsters reposing in the surf. Beyond the reef, the sea\r\n'b'sparkled beneath the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays. To the south a sharp point closed the\r\n'b'horizon, and it could not be seen if the land was prolonged in that\r\n'b'direction, or if it ran southeast and southwest, which would have made\r\n'b'this coast a very long peninsula. At the northern extremity of the bay\r\n'b'the outline of the shore was continued to a great distance in a wider\r\n'b'curve. There the shore was low, flat, without cliffs, and with great\r\n'b'banks of sand, which the tide left uncovered. Pencroft and Herbert then\r\n'b'returned towards the west. Their attention was first arrested by the\r\n'b'snow-topped mountain which rose at a distance of six or seven miles.\r\n'b'From its first declivities to within two miles of the coast were spread\r\n'b'vast masses of wood, relieved by large green patches, caused by the\r\n'b'presence of evergreen trees. Then, from the edge of this forest to the\r\n'b'shore extended a plain, scattered irregularly with groups of trees. Here\r\n'b'and there on the left sparkled through glades the waters of the little\r\n'b'river; they could trace its winding course back towards the spurs of the\r\n'b'mountain, among which it seemed to spring. At the point where the sailor\r\n'b'had left his raft of wood, it began to run between the two high granite\r\n'b'walls; but if on the left bank the wall remained clear and abrupt, on\r\n'b'the right bank, on the contrary, it sank gradually, the massive sides\r\n'b'changed to isolated rocks, the rocks to stones, the stones to shingle\r\n'b'running to the extremity of the point.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre we on an island?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, it seems to be big enough,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lad.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn island, ever so big, is an island all the same!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But this important question could not yet be answered. A more perfect\r\n'b'survey had to be made to settle the point. As to the land itself, island\r\n'b'or continent, it appeared fertile, agreeable in its aspect, and varied\r\n'b'in its productions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is satisfactory,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cand in our misfortune, we\r\n'b'must thank Providence for it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d responded Herbert, whose pious heart was full of\r\n'b'gratitude to the Author of all things.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Herbert examined for some time the country on which\r\n'b'they had been cast; but it was difficult to guess after so hasty an\r\n'b'inspection what the future had in store for them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They then returned, following the southern crest of the granite\r\n'b'platform, bordered by a long fringe of jagged rocks, of the most\r\n'b'whimsical shapes. Some hundreds of birds lived there nestled in the\r\n'b'holes of the stone; Herbert, jumping over the rocks, startled a whole\r\n'b'flock of these winged creatures.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he, \xe2\x80\x9cthose are not gulls nor sea-mews!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they then?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, one would say they were pigeons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust so, but these are wild or rock pigeons. I recognize them by\r\n'b'the double band of black on the wing, by the white tail, and by their\r\n'b'slate-colored plumage. But if the rock-pigeon is good to eat, its eggs\r\n'b'must be excellent, and we will soon see how many they may have left in\r\n'b'their nests!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not give them time to hatch, unless it is in the shape of an\r\n'b'omelet!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft merrily.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what will you make your omelet in?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cin your hat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not quite conjuror enough for that;\r\n'b'we must come down to eggs in the shell, my boy, and I will undertake to\r\n'b'despatch the hardest!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Herbert attentively examined the cavities in the granite,\r\n'b'and they really found eggs in some of the hollows. A few dozen being\r\n'b'collected, were packed in the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s handkerchief, and as the time\r\n'b'when the tide would be full was approaching, Pencroft and Herbert began\r\n'b'to redescend towards the watercourse. When they arrived there, it was\r\n'b'an hour after midday. The tide had already turned. They must now avail\r\n'b'themselves of the ebb to take the wood to the mouth. Pencroft did not\r\n'b'intend to let the raft go away in the current without guidance, neither\r\n'b'did he mean to embark on it himself to steer it. But a sailor is never\r\n'b'at a loss when there is a question of cables or ropes, and Pencroft\r\n'b'rapidly twisted a cord, a few fathoms long, made of dry creepers. This\r\n'b'vegetable cable was fastened to the after-part of the raft, and the\r\n'b'sailor held it in his hand while Herbert, pushing off the raft with\r\n'b'a long pole, kept it in the current. This succeeded capitally. The\r\n'b'enormous load of wood drifted down the current. The bank was very\r\n'b'equal; there was no fear that the raft would run aground, and before\r\n'b'two o\xe2\x80\x99clock they arrived at the river\xe2\x80\x99s mouth, a few paces from the\r\n'b'Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 5\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s first care, after unloading the raft, was to render the cave\r\n'b'habitable by stopping up all the holes which made it draughty. Sand,\r\n'b'stones, twisted branches, wet clay, closed up the galleries open to the\r\n'b'south winds. One narrow and winding opening at the side was kept, to\r\n'b'lead out the smoke and to make the fire draw. The cave was thus divided\r\n'b'into three or four rooms, if such dark dens with which a donkey would\r\n'b'scarcely have been contented deserved the name. But they were dry, and\r\n'b'there was space to stand upright, at least in the principal room, which\r\n'b'occupied the center. The floor was covered with fine sand, and taking\r\n'b'all in all they were well pleased with it for want of a better.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, while he and Pencroft were working, \xe2\x80\x9cour\r\n'b'companions have found a superior place to ours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery likely,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the seaman; \xe2\x80\x9cbut, as we don\xe2\x80\x99t know, we must work\r\n'b'all the same. Better to have two strings to one\xe2\x80\x99s bow than no string at\r\n'b'all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9chow jolly it will be if they were to find\r\n'b'Captain Harding and were to bring him back with them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat was a man of the right sort.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWas!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you despair of ever seeing him again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGod forbid!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor. Their work was soon done, and Pencroft\r\n'b'declared himself very well satisfied.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cour friends can come back when they like. They will\r\n'b'find a good enough shelter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They now had only to make a fireplace and to prepare the supper--an easy\r\n'b'task. Large flat stones were placed on the ground at the opening of the\r\n'b'narrow passage which had been kept. This, if the smoke did not take\r\n'b'the heat out with it, would be enough to maintain an equal temperature\r\n'b'inside. Their wood was stowed away in one of the rooms, and the sailor\r\n'b'laid in the fireplace some logs and brushwood. The seaman was busy with\r\n'b'this, when Herbert asked him if he had any matches.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand I may say happily, for without\r\n'b'matches or tinder we should be in a fix.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStill we might get fire as the savages do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cby\r\n'b'rubbing two bits of dry stick one against the other.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll right; try, my boy, and let\xe2\x80\x99s see if you can do anything besides\r\n'b'exercising your arms.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, it\xe2\x80\x99s a very simple proceeding, and much used in the islands of\r\n'b'the Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t deny it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the savages must know how to\r\n'b'do it or employ a peculiar wood, for more than once I have tried to\r\n'b'get fire in that way, but I could never manage it. I must say I prefer\r\n'b'matches. By the bye, where are my matches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft searched in his waistcoat for the box, which was always there,\r\n'b'for he was a confirmed smoker. He could not find it; he rummaged the\r\n'b'pockets of his trousers, but, to his horror, he could nowhere discover\r\n'b'the box.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere\xe2\x80\x99s a go!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, looking at Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cThe box must have\r\n'b'fallen out of my pocket and got lost! Surely, Herbert, you must have\r\n'b'something--a tinder-box--anything that can possibly make fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I haven\xe2\x80\x99t, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor rushed out, followed by the boy. On the sand, among the\r\n'b'rocks, near the river\xe2\x80\x99s bank, they both searched carefully, but in vain.\r\n'b'The box was of copper, and therefore would have been easily seen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cdidn\xe2\x80\x99t you throw it out of the car?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew better than that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut such a small article\r\n'b'could easily disappear in the tumbling about we have gone through. I\r\n'b'would rather even have lost my pipe! Confound the box! Where can it be?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, the tide is going down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9clet\xe2\x80\x99s run to the\r\n'b'place where we landed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was scarcely probable that they would find the box, which the waves\r\n'b'had rolled about among the pebbles, at high tide, but it was as well\r\n'b'to try. Herbert and Pencroft walked rapidly to the point where they had\r\n'b'landed the day before, about two hundred feet from the cave. They hunted\r\n'b'there, among the shingle, in the clefts of the rocks, but found nothing.\r\n'b'If the box had fallen at this place it must have been swept away by the\r\n'b'waves. As the sea went down, they searched every little crevice with\r\n'b'no result. It was a grave loss in their circumstances, and for the\r\n'b'time irreparable. Pencroft could not hide his vexation; he looked very\r\n'b'anxious, but said not a word. Herbert tried to console him by observing,\r\n'b'that if they had found the matches, they would, very likely, have been\r\n'b'wetted by the sea and useless.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cthey were in a copper box which shut\r\n'b'very tightly; and now what are we to do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall certainly find some way of making a fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding or Mr. Spilett will not be without them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cbut in the meantime we are without fire, and\r\n'b'our companions will find but a sorry repast on their return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think it possible that they have no\r\n'b'tinder or matches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI doubt it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, shaking his head, \xe2\x80\x9cfor neither Neb nor\r\n'b'Captain Harding smoke, and I believe that Mr. Spilett would rather keep\r\n'b'his note-book than his match-box.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert did not reply. The loss of the box was certainly to be\r\n'b'regretted, but the boy was still sure of procuring fire in some way or\r\n'b'other. Pencroft, more experienced, did not think so, although he was not\r\n'b'a man to trouble himself about a small or great grievance. At any rate,\r\n'b'there was only one thing to be done--to await the return of Neb and the\r\n'b'reporter; but they must give up the feast of hard eggs which they had\r\n'b'meant to prepare, and a meal of raw flesh was not an agreeable prospect\r\n'b'either for themselves or for the others.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Before returning to the cave, the sailor and Herbert, in the event of\r\n'b'fire being positively unattainable, collected some more shell-fish, and\r\n'b'then silently retraced their steps to their dwelling.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, his eyes fixed on the ground, still looked for his box. He\r\n'b'even climbed up the left bank of the river from its mouth to the angle\r\n'b'where the raft had been moored. He returned to the plateau, went over it\r\n'b'in every direction, searched among the high grass on the border of the\r\n'b'forest, all in vain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was five in the evening when he and Herbert re-entered the cave.\r\n'b'It is useless to say that the darkest corners of the passages were\r\n'b'ransacked before they were obliged to give it up in despair. Towards\r\n'b'six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when the sun was disappearing behind the high lands of the\r\n'b'west, Herbert, who was walking up and down on the strand, signalized the\r\n'b'return of Neb and Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were returning alone!... The boy\xe2\x80\x99s heart sank; the sailor had not\r\n'b'been deceived in his forebodings; the engineer, Cyrus Harding, had not\r\n'b'been found!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter, on his arrival, sat down on a rock, without saying\r\n'b'anything. Exhausted with fatigue, dying of hunger, he had not strength\r\n'b'to utter a word.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to Neb, his red eyes showed how he had cried, and the tears which he\r\n'b'could not restrain told too clearly that he had lost all hope.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter recounted all that they had done in their attempt to\r\n'b'recover Cyrus Harding. He and Neb had surveyed the coast for a distance\r\n'b'of eight miles and consequently much beyond the place where the balloon\r\n'b'had fallen the last time but one, a fall which was followed by the\r\n'b'disappearance of the engineer and the dog Top. The shore was solitary;\r\n'b'not a vestige of a mark. Not even a pebble recently displaced; not a\r\n'b'trace on the sand; not a human footstep on all that part of the beach.\r\n'b'It was clear that that portion of the shore had never been visited by\r\n'b'a human being. The sea was as deserted as the land, and it was there,\r\n'b'a few hundred feet from the coast, that the engineer must have found a\r\n'b'tomb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As Spilett ended his account, Neb jumped up, exclaiming in a voice which\r\n'b'showed how hope struggled within him, \xe2\x80\x9cNo! he is not dead! he can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\n'b'dead! It might happen to any one else, but never to him! He could get\r\n'b'out of anything!\xe2\x80\x9d Then his strength forsaking him, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! I can do no\r\n'b'more!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNeb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, running to him, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will find him! God will give\r\n'b'him back to us! But in the meantime you are hungry, and you must eat\r\n'b'something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So saying, he offered the poor Negro a few handfuls of shell-fish, which\r\n'b'was indeed wretched and insufficient food. Neb had not eaten anything\r\n'b'for several hours, but he refused them. He could not, would not live\r\n'b'without his master.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to Gideon Spilett, he devoured the shell-fish, then he laid himself\r\n'b'down on the sand, at the foot of a rock. He was very weak, but calm.\r\n'b'Herbert went up to him, and taking his hand, \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\n'b'have found a shelter which will be better than lying here. Night is\r\n'b'advancing. Come and rest! To-morrow we will search farther.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter got up, and guided by the boy went towards the cave. On\r\n'b'the way, Pencroft asked him in the most natural tone, if by chance he\r\n'b'happened to have a match or two.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter stopped, felt in his pockets, but finding nothing said, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n'b'had some, but I must have thrown them away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The seaman then put the same question to Neb and received the same\r\n'b'answer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cConfound it!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter heard him and seizing his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cHave you no matches?\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n'b'asked.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot one, and no fire in consequence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cif my master was here, he would know what to do!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The four castaways remained motionless, looking uneasily at each other.\r\n'b'Herbert was the first to break the silence by saying, \xe2\x80\x9cMr. Spilett,\r\n'b'you are a smoker and always have matches about you; perhaps you haven\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n'b'looked well, try again, a single match will be enough!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter hunted again in the pockets of his trousers, waistcoat, and\r\n'b'great-coat, and at last to Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s great joy, no less to his extreme\r\n'b'surprise, he felt a tiny piece of wood entangled in the lining of his\r\n'b'waistcoat. He seized it with his fingers through the stuff, but he could\r\n'b'not get it out. If this was a match and a single one, it was of great\r\n'b'importance not to rub off the phosphorus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWill you let me try?\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, and very cleverly, without breaking\r\n'b'it, he managed to draw out the wretched yet precious little bit of wood\r\n'b'which was of such great importance to these poor men. It was unused.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cit is as good as having a whole cargo!\xe2\x80\x9d He\r\n'b'took the match, and, followed by his companions, entered the cave.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This small piece of wood, of which so many in an inhabited country are\r\n'b'wasted with indifference and are of no value, must here be used with the\r\n'b'greatest caution.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor first made sure that it was quite dry; that done, \xe2\x80\x9cWe must\r\n'b'have some paper,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Spilett, after some hesitation tearing a leaf out of his\r\n'b'note-book.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft took the piece of paper which the reporter held out to him, and\r\n'b'knelt down before the fireplace. Some handfuls of grass, leaves, and dry\r\n'b'moss were placed under the fagots and disposed in such a way that the\r\n'b'air could easily circulate, and the dry wood would rapidly catch fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft then twisted the piece of paper into the shape of a cone, as\r\n'b'smokers do in a high wind, and poked it in among the moss. Taking a\r\n'b'small, rough stone, he wiped it carefully, and with a beating heart,\r\n'b'holding his breath, he gently rubbed the match. The first attempt did\r\n'b'not produce any effect. Pencroft had not struck hard enough, fearing to\r\n'b'rub off the phosphorus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I can\xe2\x80\x99t do it,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cmy hand trembles, the match has missed\r\n'b'fire; I cannot, I will not!\xe2\x80\x9d and rising, he told Herbert to take his\r\n'b'place.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Certainly the boy had never in all his life been so nervous. Prometheus\r\n'b'going to steal the fire from heaven could not have been more anxious. He\r\n'b'did not hesitate, however, but struck the match directly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A little spluttering was heard and a tiny blue flame sprang up, making\r\n'b'a choking smoke. Herbert quickly turned the match so as to augment the\r\n'b'flame, and then slipped it into the paper cone, which in a few seconds\r\n'b'too caught fire, and then the moss.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A minute later the dry wood crackled and a cheerful flame, assisted\r\n'b'by the vigorous blowing of the sailor, sprang up in the midst of the\r\n'b'darkness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt last!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, getting up; \xe2\x80\x9cI was never so nervous before in\r\n'b'all my life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The flat stones made a capital fireplace. The smoke went quite easily\r\n'b'out at the narrow passage, the chimney drew, and an agreeable warmth was\r\n'b'not long in being felt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They must now take great care not to let the fire go out, and always to\r\n'b'keep some embers alight. It only needed care and attention, as they had\r\n'b'plenty of wood and could renew their store at any time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s first thought was to use the fire by preparing a more\r\n'b'nourishing supper than a dish of shell-fish. Two dozen eggs were\r\n'b'brought by Herbert. The reporter leaning up in a corner, watched these\r\n'b'preparations without saying anything. A threefold thought weighed on his\r\n'b'mind. Was Cyrus still alive? If he was alive, where was he? If he had\r\n'b'survived from his fall, how was it that he had not found some means of\r\n'b'making known his existence? As to Neb, he was roaming about the shore.\r\n'b'He was like a body without a soul.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft knew fifty ways of cooking eggs, but this time he had no\r\n'b'choice, and was obliged to content himself with roasting them under\r\n'b'the hot cinders. In a few minutes the cooking was done, and the seaman\r\n'b'invited the reporter to take his share of the supper. Such was the\r\n'b'first repast of the castaways on this unknown coast. The hard eggs\r\n'b'were excellent, and as eggs contain everything indispensable to man\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'nourishment, these poor people thought themselves well off, and were\r\n'b'much strengthened by them. Oh! if only one of them had not been missing\r\n'b'at this meal! If the five prisoners who escaped from Richmond had been\r\n'b'all there, under the piled-up rocks, before this clear, crackling fire\r\n'b'on the dry sand, what thanksgiving must they have rendered to Heaven!\r\n'b'But the most ingenious, the most learned, he who was their unquestioned\r\n'b'chief, Cyrus Harding, was, alas! missing, and his body had not even\r\n'b'obtained a burial-place.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus passed the 25th of March. Night had come on. Outside could be heard\r\n'b'the howling of the wind and the monotonous sound of the surf breaking\r\n'b'on the shore. The waves rolled the shingle backwards and forwards with a\r\n'b'deafening noise.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter retired into a dark corner after having shortly noted down\r\n'b'the occurrences of the day; the first appearance of this new land, the\r\n'b'loss of their leader, the exploration of the coast, the incident of the\r\n'b'matches, etc.; and then overcome by fatigue, he managed to forget his\r\n'b'sorrows in sleep. Herbert went to sleep directly. As to the sailor, he\r\n'b'passed the night with one eye on the fire, on which he did not\r\n'b'spare fuel. But one of the castaways did not sleep in the cave. The\r\n'b'inconsolable, despairing Neb, notwithstanding all that his companions\r\n'b'could say to induce him to take some rest, wandered all night long on\r\n'b'the shore calling on his master.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 6\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The inventory of the articles possessed by these castaways from the\r\n'b'clouds, thrown upon a coast which appeared to be uninhabited, was soon\r\n'b'made out. They had nothing, save the clothes which they were wearing at\r\n'b'the time of the catastrophe. We must mention, however, a note-book and\r\n'b'a watch which Gideon Spilett had kept, doubtless by inadvertence, not a\r\n'b'weapon, not a tool, not even a pocket-knife; for while in the car they\r\n'b'had thrown out everything to lighten the balloon. The imaginary heroes\r\n'b'of Daniel Defoe or of Wyss, as well as Selkirk and Raynal shipwrecked\r\n'b'on Juan Fernandez and on the archipelago of the Aucklands, were never in\r\n'b'such absolute destitution. Either they had abundant resources from their\r\n'b'stranded vessels, in grain, cattle, tools, ammunition, or else some\r\n'b'things were thrown up on the coast which supplied them with all the\r\n'b'first necessities of life. But here, not any instrument whatever, not a\r\n'b'utensil. From nothing they must supply themselves with everything.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And yet, if Cyrus Harding had been with them, if the engineer could\r\n'b'have brought his practical science, his inventive mind to bear on their\r\n'b'situation, perhaps all hope would not have been lost. Alas! they must\r\n'b'hope no longer again to see Cyrus Harding. The castaways could expect\r\n'b'nothing but from themselves and from that Providence which never\r\n'b'abandons those whose faith is sincere.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But ought they to establish themselves on this part of the coast,\r\n'b'without trying to know to what continent it belonged, if it was\r\n'b'inhabited, or if they were on the shore of a desert island?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was an important question, and should be solved with the shortest\r\n'b'possible delay. From its answer they would know what measures to take.\r\n'b'However, according to Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s advice, it appeared best to wait a few\r\n'b'days before commencing an exploration. They must, in fact, prepare some\r\n'b'provisions and procure more strengthening food than eggs and molluscs.\r\n'b'The explorers, before undertaking new fatigues, must first of all\r\n'b'recruit their strength.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The Chimneys offered a retreat sufficient for the present. The fire was\r\n'b'lighted, and it was easy to preserve some embers. There were plenty of\r\n'b'shell-fish and eggs among the rocks and on the beach. It would be easy\r\n'b'to kill a few of the pigeons which were flying by hundreds about the\r\n'b'summit of the plateau, either with sticks or stones. Perhaps the trees\r\n'b'of the neighboring forest would supply them with eatable fruit. Lastly,\r\n'b'the sweet water was there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was accordingly settled that for a few days they would remain at the\r\n'b'Chimneys so as to prepare themselves for an expedition, either along\r\n'b'the shore or into the interior of the country. This plan suited Neb\r\n'b'particularly. As obstinate in his ideas as in his presentiments, he\r\n'b'was in no haste to abandon this part of the coast, the scene of the\r\n'b'catastrophe. He did not, he would not believe in the loss of Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding. No, it did not seem to him possible that such a man had ended\r\n'b'in this vulgar fashion, carried away by a wave, drowned in the floods, a\r\n'b'few hundred feet from a shore. As long as the waves had not cast up the\r\n'b'body of the engineer, as long as he, Neb, had not seen with his eyes,\r\n'b'touched with his hands the corpse of his master, he would not believe\r\n'b'in his death! And this idea rooted itself deeper than ever in his\r\n'b'determined heart. An illusion perhaps, but still an illusion to be\r\n'b'respected, and one which the sailor did not wish to destroy. As for him,\r\n'b'he hoped no longer, but there was no use in arguing with Neb. He was\r\n'b'like the dog who will not leave the place where his master is buried,\r\n'b'and his grief was such that most probably he would not survive him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This same morning, the 26th of March, at daybreak, Neb had set out on\r\n'b'the shore in a northerly direction, and he had returned to the spot\r\n'b'where the sea, no doubt, had closed over the unfortunate Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That day\xe2\x80\x99s breakfast was composed solely of pigeon\xe2\x80\x99s eggs and\r\n'b'lithodomes. Herbert had found some salt deposited by evaporation in the\r\n'b'hollows of the rocks, and this mineral was very welcome.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The repast ended, Pencroft asked the reporter if he wished to accompany\r\n'b'Herbert and himself to the forest, where they were going to try to\r\n'b'hunt. But on consideration, it was thought necessary that someone should\r\n'b'remain to keep in the fire, and to be at hand in the highly improbable\r\n'b'event of Neb requiring aid. The reporter accordingly remained behind.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo the chase, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe shall find ammunition\r\n'b'on our way, and cut our weapons in the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d But at the moment of\r\n'b'starting, Herbert observed, that since they had no tinder, it would\r\n'b'perhaps be prudent to replace it by another substance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBurnt linen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the boy. \xe2\x80\x9cThat could in case of need serve for\r\n'b'tinder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor thought it very sensible advice. Only it had the\r\n'b'inconvenience of necessitating the sacrifice of a piece of handkerchief.\r\n'b'Notwithstanding, the thing was well worth while trying, and a part of\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s large checked handkerchief was soon reduced to the state of\r\n'b'a half-burnt rag. This inflammable material was placed in the central\r\n'b'chamber at the bottom of a little cavity in the rock, sheltered from all\r\n'b'wind and damp.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. The weather was threatening and the\r\n'b'breeze blew from the southeast. Herbert and Pencroft turned the angle of\r\n'b'the Chimneys, not without having cast a look at the smoke which, just at\r\n'b'that place, curled round a point of rock: they ascended the left bank of\r\n'b'the river.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Arrived at the forest, Pencroft broke from the first tree two stout\r\n'b'branches which he transformed into clubs, the ends of which Herbert\r\n'b'rubbed smooth on a rock. Oh! what would they not have given for a knife!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The two hunters now advanced among the long grass, following the bank.\r\n'b'From the turning which directed its course to the southwest, the river\r\n'b'narrowed gradually and the channel lay between high banks, over\r\n'b'which the trees formed a double arch. Pencroft, lest they should lose\r\n'b'themselves, resolved to follow the course of the stream, which would\r\n'b'always lead them back to the point from which they started. But the bank\r\n'b'was not without some obstacles: here, the flexible branches of the trees\r\n'b'bent level with the current; there, creepers and thorns which they had\r\n'b'to break down with their sticks. Herbert often glided among the\r\n'b'broken stumps with the agility of a young cat, and disappeared in the\r\n'b'underwood. But Pencroft called him back directly, begging him not to\r\n'b'wander away. Meanwhile, the sailor attentively observed the disposition\r\n'b'and nature of the surrounding country. On the left bank, the ground,\r\n'b'which was flat and marshy, rose imperceptibly towards the interior. It\r\n'b'looked there like a network of liquid threads which doubtless reached\r\n'b'the river by some underground drain. Sometimes a stream ran through the\r\n'b'underwood, which they crossed without difficulty. The opposite shore\r\n'b'appeared to be more uneven, and the valley of which the river occupied\r\n'b'the bottom was more clearly visible. The hill, covered with trees\r\n'b'disposed in terraces, intercepted the view. On the right bank walking\r\n'b'would have been difficult, for the declivities fell suddenly, and the\r\n'b'trees bending over the water were only sustained by the strength of\r\n'b'their roots.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is needless to add that this forest, as well as the coast already\r\n'b'surveyed, was destitute of any sign of human life. Pencroft only saw\r\n'b'traces of quadrupeds, fresh footprints of animals, of which he could not\r\n'b'recognize the species. In all probability, and such was also Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'opinion, some had been left by formidable wild beasts which doubtless\r\n'b'would give them some trouble; but nowhere did they observe the mark of\r\n'b'an axe on the trees, nor the ashes of a fire, nor the impression of a\r\n'b'human foot. On this they might probably congratulate themselves, for on\r\n'b'any land in the middle of the Pacific the presence of man was perhaps\r\n'b'more to be feared than desired. Herbert and Pencroft speaking little,\r\n'b'for the difficulties of the way were great, advanced very slowly, and\r\n'b'after walking for an hour they had scarcely gone more than a mile.\r\n'b'As yet the hunt had not been successful. However, some birds sang\r\n'b'and fluttered in the foliage, and appeared very timid, as if man had\r\n'b'inspired them with an instinctive fear. Among others, Herbert described,\r\n'b'in a marshy part of the forest, a bird with a long pointed beak, closely\r\n'b'resembling the king-fisher, but its plumage was not fine, though of a\r\n'b'metallic brilliancy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat must be a jacamar,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, trying to get nearer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis will be a good opportunity to taste jacamar,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cif that fellow is in a humor to be roasted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Just then, a stone cleverly thrown by the boy, struck the creature on\r\n'b'the wing, but the blow did not disable it, and the jacamar ran off and\r\n'b'disappeared in an instant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow clumsy I am!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no, my boy!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cThe blow was well aimed; many a\r\n'b'one would have missed it altogether! Come, don\xe2\x80\x99t be vexed with yourself.\r\n'b'We shall catch it another day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As the hunters advanced, the trees were found to be more scattered, many\r\n'b'being magnificent, but none bore eatable fruit. Pencroft searched in\r\n'b'vain for some of those precious palm-trees which are employed in so many\r\n'b'ways in domestic life, and which have been found as far as the fortieth\r\n'b'parallel in the Northern Hemisphere, and to the thirty-fifth only in\r\n'b'the Southern Hemisphere. But this forest was only composed of coniferae,\r\n'b'such as deodaras, already recognized by Herbert, and Douglas pine,\r\n'b'similar to those which grow on the northwest coast of America, and\r\n'b'splendid firs, measuring a hundred and fifty feet in height.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this moment a flock of birds, of a small size and pretty plumage,\r\n'b'with long glancing tails, dispersed themselves among the branches\r\n'b'strewing their feathers, which covered the ground as with fine down.\r\n'b'Herbert picked up a few of these feathers, and after having examined\r\n'b'them,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese are couroucous,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI should prefer a moor-cock or guinea-fowl,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cstill,\r\n'b'if they are good to eat--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are good to eat, and also their flesh is very delicate,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\n'b'Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, if I don\xe2\x80\x99t mistake, it is easy to approach and kill\r\n'b'them with a stick.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor and the lad, creeping among the grass, arrived at the foot\r\n'b'of a tree, whose lower branches were covered with little birds. The\r\n'b'couroucous were waiting the passage of insects which served for their\r\n'b'nourishment. Their feathery feet could be seen clasping the slender\r\n'b'twigs which supported them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The hunters then rose, and using their sticks like scythes, they mowed\r\n'b'down whole rows of these couroucous, who never thought of flying away,\r\n'b'and stupidly allowed themselves to be knocked off. A hundred were\r\n'b'already heaped on the ground, before the others made up their minds to\r\n'b'fly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9chere is game, which is quite within the reach of\r\n'b'hunters like us. We have only to put out our hands and take it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor having strung the couroucous like larks on flexible twigs,\r\n'b'they then continued their exploration. The stream here made a bend\r\n'b'towards the south, but this detour was probably not prolonged for the\r\n'b'river must have its source in the mountain, and be supplied by the\r\n'b'melting of the snow which covered the sides of the central cone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The particular object of their expedition was, as has been said, to\r\n'b'procure the greatest possible quantity of game for the inhabitants of\r\n'b'the Chimneys. It must be acknowledged that as yet this object had not\r\n'b'been attained. So the sailor actively pursued his researches, though he\r\n'b'exclaimed, when some animal which he had not even time to recognize\r\n'b'fled into the long grass, \xe2\x80\x9cIf only we had had the dog Top!\xe2\x80\x9d But Top had\r\n'b'disappeared at the same time as his master, and had probably perished\r\n'b'with him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards three o\xe2\x80\x99clock new flocks of birds were seen through certain\r\n'b'trees, at whose aromatic berries they were pecking, those of the\r\n'b'juniper-tree among others. Suddenly a loud trumpet call resounded\r\n'b'through the forest. This strange and sonorous cry was produced by a game\r\n'b'bird called grouse in the United States. They soon saw several couples,\r\n'b'whose plumage was rich chestnut-brown mottled with dark brown, and tail\r\n'b'of the same color. Herbert recognized the males by the two wing-like\r\n'b'appendages raised on the neck. Pencroft determined to get hold of at\r\n'b'least one of these gallinaceae, which were as large as a fowl, and whose\r\n'b'flesh is better than that of a pullet. But it was difficult, for they\r\n'b'would not allow themselves to be approached. After several fruitless\r\n'b'attempts, which resulted in nothing but scaring the grouse, the sailor\r\n'b'said to the lad,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, since we can\xe2\x80\x99t kill them on the wing, we must try to take\r\n'b'them with a line.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLike a fish?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, much surprised at the proposal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLike a fish,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor quite seriously. Pencroft had found\r\n'b'among the grass half a dozen grouse nests, each having three or four\r\n'b'eggs. He took great care not to touch these nests, to which their\r\n'b'proprietors would not fail to return. It was around these that he\r\n'b'meant to stretch his lines, not snares, but real fishing-lines. He took\r\n'b'Herbert to some distance from the nests, and there prepared his singular\r\n'b'apparatus with all the care which a disciple of Izaak Walton would\r\n'b'have used. Herbert watched the work with great interest, though rather\r\n'b'doubting its success. The lines were made of fine creepers, fastened\r\n'b'one to the other, of the length of fifteen or twenty feet. Thick, strong\r\n'b'thorns, the points bent back (which were supplied from a dwarf acacia\r\n'b'bush) were fastened to the ends of the creepers, by way of hooks. Large\r\n'b'red worms, which were crawling on the ground, furnished bait.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This done, Pencroft, passing among the grass and concealing himself\r\n'b'skillfully, placed the end of his lines armed with hooks near the grouse\r\n'b'nests; then he returned, took the other ends and hid with Herbert behind\r\n'b'a large tree. There they both waited patiently; though, it must be\r\n'b'said, that Herbert did not reckon much on the success of the inventive\r\n'b'Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A whole half-hour passed, but then, as the sailor had surmised, several\r\n'b'couple of grouse returned to their nests. They walked along, pecking the\r\n'b'ground, and not suspecting in any way the presence of the hunters,\r\n'b'who, besides, had taken care to place themselves to leeward of the\r\n'b'gallinaceae.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The lad felt at this moment highly interested. He held his breath, and\r\n'b'Pencroft, his eyes staring, his mouth open, his lips advanced, as if\r\n'b'about to taste a piece of grouse, scarcely breathed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, the birds walked about the hooks, without taking any notice\r\n'b'of them. Pencroft then gave little tugs which moved the bait as if the\r\n'b'worms had been still alive.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor undoubtedly felt much greater anxiety than does the\r\n'b'fisherman, for he does not see his prey coming through the water. The\r\n'b'jerks attracted the attention of the gallinaceae, and they attacked the\r\n'b'hooks with their beaks. Three voracious grouse swallowed at the same\r\n'b'moment bait and hook. Suddenly with a smart jerk, Pencroft \xe2\x80\x9cstruck\xe2\x80\x9d his\r\n'b'line, and a flapping of wings showed that the birds were taken.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, rushing towards the game, of which he made himself\r\n'b'master in an instant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert clapped his hands. It was the first time that he had ever seen\r\n'b'birds taken with a line, but the sailor modestly confessed that it was\r\n'b'not his first attempt, and that besides he could not claim the merit of\r\n'b'invention.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9csituated as we are, we must hope to hit\r\n'b'upon many other contrivances.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The grouse were fastened by their claws, and Pencroft, delighted at not\r\n'b'having to appear before their companions with empty hands, and observing\r\n'b'that the day had begun to decline, judged it best to return to their\r\n'b'dwelling.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The direction was indicated by the river, whose course they had only\r\n'b'to follow, and, towards six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, tired enough with their excursion,\r\n'b'Herbert and Pencroft arrived at the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 7\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett was standing motionless on the shore, his arms crossed,\r\n'b'gazing over the sea, the horizon of which was lost towards the east in\r\n'b'a thick black cloud which was spreading rapidly towards the zenith.\r\n'b'The wind was already strong, and increased with the decline of day.\r\n'b'The whole sky was of a threatening aspect, and the first symptoms of a\r\n'b'violent storm were clearly visible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert entered the Chimneys, and Pencroft went towards the reporter.\r\n'b'The latter, deeply absorbed, did not see him approach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are going to have a dirty night, Mr. Spilett!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor:\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPetrels delight in wind and rain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter, turning at the moment, saw Pencroft, and his first words\r\n'b'were,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt what distance from the coast would you say the car was, when the\r\n'b'waves carried off our companion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor had not expected this question. He reflected an instant and\r\n'b'replied,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTwo cables lengths at the most.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what is a cable\xe2\x80\x99s length?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a hundred and twenty fathoms, or six hundred feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cCyrus Harding must have disappeared twelve\r\n'b'hundred feet at the most from the shore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd his dog also?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlso.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat astonishes me,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cwhile admitting that our\r\n'b'companion has perished, is that Top has also met his death, and that\r\n'b'neither the body of the dog nor of his master has been cast on the\r\n'b'shore!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not astonishing, with such a heavy sea,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, it is possible that currents have carried them farther down\r\n'b'the coast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, it is your opinion that our friend has perished in the waves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' again asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy own opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cwith due deference to your\r\n'b'experience, Pencroft, is that in the double fact of the absolute\r\n'b'disappearance of Cyrus and Top, living or dead, there is something\r\n'b'unaccountable and unlikely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI wish I could think like you, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft;\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cunhappily, my mind is made up on this point.\xe2\x80\x9d Having said this, the\r\n'b'sailor returned to the Chimneys. A good fire crackled on the hearth.\r\n'b'Herbert had just thrown on an armful of dry wood, and the flame cast a\r\n'b'bright light into the darkest parts of the passage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft immediately began to prepare the dinner. It appeared best to\r\n'b'introduce something solid into the bill of fare, for all needed to get\r\n'b'up their strength. The strings of couroucous were kept for the next day,\r\n'b'but they plucked a couple of grouse, which were soon spitted on a stick,\r\n'b'and roasting before a blazing fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At seven in the evening Neb had not returned. The prolonged absence of\r\n'b'the Negro made Pencroft very uneasy. It was to be feared that he had met\r\n'b'with an accident on this unknown land, or that the unhappy fellow had\r\n'b'been driven to some act of despair. But Herbert drew very different\r\n'b'conclusions from this absence. According to him, Neb\xe2\x80\x99s delay was caused\r\n'b'by some new circumstances which had induced him to prolong his search.\r\n'b'Also, everything new must be to the advantage of Cyrus Harding. Why had\r\n'b'Neb not returned unless hope still detained him? Perhaps he had found\r\n'b'some mark, a footstep, a trace which had put him in the right path.\r\n'b'Perhaps he was at this moment on a certain track. Perhaps even he was\r\n'b'near his master.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus the lad reasoned. Thus he spoke. His companions let him talk. The\r\n'b'reporter alone approved with a gesture. But what Pencroft thought most\r\n'b'probable was, that Neb had pushed his researches on the shore farther\r\n'b'than the day before, and that he had not as yet had time to return.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert, however, agitated by vague presentiments, several times\r\n'b'manifested an intention to go to meet Neb. But Pencroft assured him\r\n'b'that that would be a useless course, that in the darkness and deplorable\r\n'b'weather he could not find any traces of Neb, and that it would be much\r\n'b'better to wait. If Neb had not made his appearance by the next day,\r\n'b'Pencroft would not hesitate to join him in his search.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett approved of the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that it was best not to\r\n'b'divide, and Herbert was obliged to give up his project; but two large\r\n'b'tears fell from his eyes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter could not refrain from embracing the generous boy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Bad weather now set in. A furious gale from the southeast passed over\r\n'b'the coast. The sea roared as it beat over the reef. Heavy rain was\r\n'b'dashed by the storm into particles like dust. Ragged masses of vapor\r\n'b'drove along the beach, on which the tormented shingles sounded as if\r\n'b'poured out in cart-loads, while the sand raised by the wind added as\r\n'b'it were mineral dust to that which was liquid, and rendered the united\r\n'b'attack insupportable. Between the river\xe2\x80\x99s mouth and the end of the\r\n'b'cliff, eddies of wind whirled and gusts from this maelstrom lashed the\r\n'b'water which ran through the narrow valley. The smoke from the fireplace\r\n'b'was also driven back through the opening, filling the passages and\r\n'b'rendering them uninhabitable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Therefore, as the grouse were cooked, Pencroft let the fire die away,\r\n'b'and only preserved a few embers buried under the ashes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock Neb had not appeared, but there was no doubt that the\r\n'b'frightful weather alone hindered his return, and that he must have\r\n'b'taken refuge in some cave, to await the end of the storm or at least the\r\n'b'return of day. As to going to meet him, or attempting to find him, it\r\n'b'was impossible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The game constituted the only dish at supper; the meat was excellent,\r\n'b'and Pencroft and Herbert, whose long excursion had rendered them very\r\n'b'hungry, devoured it with infinite satisfaction.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their meal concluded, each retired to the corner in which he had rested\r\n'b'the preceding night, and Herbert was not long in going to sleep near the\r\n'b'sailor, who had stretched himself beside the fireplace.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Outside, as the night advanced, the tempest also increased in strength,\r\n'b'until it was equal to that which had carried the prisoners from Richmond\r\n'b'to this land in the Pacific. The tempests which are frequent during the\r\n'b'seasons of the equinox, and which are so prolific in catastrophes, are\r\n'b'above all terrible over this immense ocean, which opposes no obstacle to\r\n'b'their fury. No description can give an idea of the terrific violence of\r\n'b'the gale as it beat upon the unprotected coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Happily the pile of rocks which formed the Chimneys was solid. It was\r\n'b'composed of enormous blocks of granite, a few of which, insecurely\r\n'b'balanced, seemed to tremble on their foundations, and Pencroft could\r\n'b'feel rapid quiverings under his head as it rested on the rock. But he\r\n'b'repeated to himself, and rightly, that there was nothing to fear, and\r\n'b'that their retreat would not give way. However he heard the noise of\r\n'b'stones torn from the summit of the plateau by the wind, falling down on\r\n'b'to the beach. A few even rolled on to the upper part of the Chimneys,\r\n'b'or flew off in fragments when they were projected perpendicularly. Twice\r\n'b'the sailor rose and intrenched himself at the opening of the passage, so\r\n'b'as to take a look in safety at the outside. But there was nothing to be\r\n'b'feared from these showers, which were not considerable, and he returned\r\n'b'to his couch before the fireplace, where the embers glowed beneath the\r\n'b'ashes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Notwithstanding the fury of the hurricane, the uproar of the tempest,\r\n'b'the thunder, and the tumult, Herbert slept profoundly. Sleep at last\r\n'b'took possession of Pencroft, whom a seafaring life had habituated to\r\n'b'anything. Gideon Spilett alone was kept awake by anxiety. He reproached\r\n'b'himself with not having accompanied Neb. It was evident that he had not\r\n'b'abandoned all hope. The presentiments which had troubled Herbert did not\r\n'b'cease to agitate him also. His thoughts were concentrated on Neb. Why\r\n'b'had Neb not returned? He tossed about on his sandy couch, scarcely\r\n'b'giving a thought to the struggle of the elements. Now and then, his\r\n'b'eyes, heavy with fatigue, closed for an instant, but some sudden thought\r\n'b'reopened them almost immediately.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile the night advanced, and it was perhaps two hours from morning,\r\n'b'when Pencroft, then sound asleep, was vigorously shaken.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, rousing himself, and collecting his ideas\r\n'b'with the promptitude usual to seamen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter was leaning over him, and saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Pencroft, listen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor strained his ears, but could hear no noise beyond those\r\n'b'caused by the storm.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, listening again, \xe2\x80\x9cI thought I heard--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe barking of a dog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA dog!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, springing up.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes--barking--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s not possible!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides, how, in the\r\n'b'roaring of the storm--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStop--listen--\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft listened more attentively, and really thought he heard, during\r\n'b'a lull, distant barking.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, pressing the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes--yes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Top! It is Top!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, who had just awoke; and all three\r\n'b'rushed towards the opening of the Chimneys. They had great difficulty in\r\n'b'getting out. The wind drove them back. But at last they succeeded, and\r\n'b'could only remain standing by leaning against the rocks. They looked\r\n'b'about, but could not speak. The darkness was intense. The sea, the sky,\r\n'b'the land were all mingled in one black mass. Not a speck of light was\r\n'b'visible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter and his companions remained thus for a few minutes,\r\n'b'overwhelmed by the wind, drenched by the rain, blinded by the sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, in a pause of the tumult, they again heard the barking, which they\r\n'b'found must be at some distance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It could only be Top! But was he alone or accompanied? He was most\r\n'b'probably alone, for, if Neb had been with him, he would have made\r\n'b'his way more directly towards the Chimneys. The sailor squeezed the\r\n'b'reporter\xe2\x80\x99s hand, for he could not make himself heard, in a way which\r\n'b'signified \xe2\x80\x9cWait!\xe2\x80\x9d then he reentered the passage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An instant after he issued with a lighted fagot, which he threw into the\r\n'b'darkness, whistling shrilly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It appeared as if this signal had been waited for; the barking\r\n'b'immediately came nearer, and soon a dog bounded into the passage.\r\n'b'Pencroft, Herbert, and Spilett entered after him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An armful of dry wood was thrown on the embers. The passage was lighted\r\n'b'up with a bright flame.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Top!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was indeed Top, a magnificent Anglo-Norman, who derived from these\r\n'b'two races crossed the swiftness of foot and the acuteness of smell which\r\n'b'are the preeminent qualities of coursing dogs. It was the dog of the\r\n'b'engineer, Cyrus Harding. But he was alone! Neither Neb nor his master\r\n'b'accompanied him!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'How was it that his instinct had guided him straight to the Chimneys,\r\n'b'which he did not know? It appeared inexplicable, above all, in the\r\n'b'midst of this black night and in such a tempest! But what was still more\r\n'b'inexplicable was, that Top was neither tired, nor exhausted, nor even\r\n'b'soiled with mud or sand!--Herbert had drawn him towards him, and was\r\n'b'patting his head, the dog rubbing his neck against the lad\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf the dog is found, the master will be found also!\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGod grant it!\xe2\x80\x9d responded Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us set off! Top will guide us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft did not make any objection. He felt that Top\xe2\x80\x99s arrival\r\n'b'contradicted his conjectures. \xe2\x80\x9cCome along then!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft carefully covered the embers on the hearth. He placed a few\r\n'b'pieces of wood among them, so as to keep in the fire until their return.\r\n'b'Then, preceded by the dog, who seemed to invite them by short barks to\r\n'b'come with him, and followed by the reporter and the boy, he dashed out,\r\n'b'after having put up in his handkerchief the remains of the supper.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The storm was then in all its violence, and perhaps at its height. Not a\r\n'b'single ray of light from the moon pierced through the clouds. To follow\r\n'b'a straight course was difficult. It was best to rely on Top\xe2\x80\x99s instinct.\r\n'b'They did so. The reporter and Herbert walked behind the dog, and the\r\n'b'sailor brought up the rear. It was impossible to exchange a word. The\r\n'b'rain was not very heavy, but the wind was terrific.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, one circumstance favored the seaman and his two companions. The\r\n'b'wind being southeast, consequently blew on their backs. The clouds of\r\n'b'sand, which otherwise would have been insupportable, from being received\r\n'b'behind, did not in consequence impede their progress. In short, they\r\n'b'sometimes went faster than they liked, and had some difficulty in\r\n'b'keeping their feet; but hope gave them strength, for it was not at\r\n'b'random that they made their way along the shore. They had no doubt that\r\n'b'Neb had found his master, and that he had sent them the faithful dog.\r\n'b'But was the engineer living, or had Neb only sent for his companions\r\n'b'that they might render the last duties to the corpse of the unfortunate\r\n'b'Harding?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After having passed the precipice, Herbert, the reporter, and Pencroft\r\n'b'prudently stepped aside to stop and take breath. The turn of the rocks\r\n'b'sheltered them from the wind, and they could breathe after this walk or\r\n'b'rather run of a quarter of an hour.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They could now hear and reply to each other, and the lad having\r\n'b'pronounced the name of Cyrus Harding, Top gave a few short barks, as\r\n'b'much as to say that his master was saved.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSaved, isn\xe2\x80\x99t he?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9csaved, Top?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the dog barked in reply.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They once more set out. The tide began to rise, and urged by the wind it\r\n'b'threatened to be unusually high, as it was a spring tide. Great billows\r\n'b'thundered against the reef with such violence that they probably passed\r\n'b'entirely over the islet, then quite invisible. The mole no longer\r\n'b'protected the coast, which was directly exposed to the attacks of the\r\n'b'open sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As soon as the sailor and his companions left the precipice, the wind\r\n'b'struck them again with renewed fury. Though bent under the gale they\r\n'b'walked very quickly, following Top, who did not hesitate as to what\r\n'b'direction to take.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They ascended towards the north, having on their left an interminable\r\n'b'extent of billows, which broke with a deafening noise, and on their\r\n'b'right a dark country, the aspect of which it was impossible to guess.\r\n'b'But they felt that it was comparatively flat, for the wind passed\r\n'b'completely over them, without being driven back as it was when it came\r\n'b'in contact with the cliff.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, they reckoned that they had cleared\r\n'b'about five miles. The clouds were slightly raised, and the wind, though\r\n'b'less damp, was very sharp and cold. Insufficiently protected by their\r\n'b'clothing, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett suffered cruelly, but not\r\n'b'a complaint escaped their lips. They were determined to follow Top,\r\n'b'wherever the intelligent animal wished to lead them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards five o\xe2\x80\x99clock day began to break. At the zenith, where the fog\r\n'b'was less thick, gray shades bordered the clouds; under an opaque belt, a\r\n'b'luminous line clearly traced the horizon. The crests of the billows were\r\n'b'tipped with a wild light, and the foam regained its whiteness. At the\r\n'b'same time on the left the hilly parts of the coast could be seen, though\r\n'b'very indistinctly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock day had broken. The clouds rapidly lifted. The seaman and\r\n'b'his companions were then about six miles from the Chimneys. They were\r\n'b'following a very flat shore bounded by a reef of rocks, whose heads\r\n'b'scarcely emerged from the sea, for they were in deep water. On the left,\r\n'b'the country appeared to be one vast extent of sandy downs, bristling\r\n'b'with thistles. There was no cliff, and the shore offered no resistance\r\n'b'to the ocean but a chain of irregular hillocks. Here and there grew two\r\n'b'or three trees, inclined towards the west, their branches projecting in\r\n'b'that direction. Quite behind, in the southwest, extended the border of\r\n'b'the forest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this moment, Top became very excited. He ran forward, then returned,\r\n'b'and seemed to entreat them to hasten their steps. The dog then left the\r\n'b'beach, and guided by his wonderful instinct, without showing the least\r\n'b'hesitation, went straight in among the downs. They followed him. The\r\n'b'country appeared an absolute desert. Not a living creature was to be\r\n'b'seen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The downs, the extent of which was large, were composed of hillocks\r\n'b'and even of hills, very irregularly distributed. They resembled a\r\n'b'Switzerland modeled in sand, and only an amazing instinct could have\r\n'b'possibly recognized the way.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Five minutes after having left the beach, the reporter and his two\r\n'b'companions arrived at a sort of excavation, hollowed out at the back of\r\n'b'a high mound. There Top stopped, and gave a loud, clear bark. Spilett,\r\n'b'Herbert, and Pencroft dashed into the cave.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb was there, kneeling beside a body extended on a bed of grass.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The body was that of the engineer, Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 8\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb did not move. Pencroft only uttered one word.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLiving?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb did not reply. Spilett and the sailor turned pale. Herbert clasped\r\n'b'his hands, and remained motionless. The poor Negro, absorbed in his\r\n'b'grief, evidently had neither seen his companions nor heard the sailor\r\n'b'speak.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter knelt down beside the motionless body, and placed his ear\r\n'b'to the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s chest, having first torn open his clothes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A minute--an age!--passed, during which he endeavored to catch the\r\n'b'faintest throb of the heart.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb had raised himself a little and gazed without seeing. Despair had\r\n'b'completely changed his countenance. He could scarcely be recognized,\r\n'b'exhausted with fatigue, broken with grief. He believed his master was\r\n'b'dead.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett at last rose, after a long and attentive examination.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe lives!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft knelt in his turn beside the engineer, he also heard a\r\n'b'throbbing, and even felt a slight breath on his cheek.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert at a word from the reporter ran out to look for water. He found,\r\n'b'a hundred feet off, a limpid stream, which seemed to have been greatly\r\n'b'increased by the rains, and which filtered through the sand; but nothing\r\n'b'in which to put the water, not even a shell among the downs. The lad was\r\n'b'obliged to content himself with dipping his handkerchief in the stream,\r\n'b'and with it hastened back to the grotto.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Happily the wet handkerchief was enough for Gideon Spilett, who only\r\n'b'wished to wet the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s lips. The cold water produced an almost\r\n'b'immediate effect. His chest heaved and he seemed to try to speak.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will save him!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At these words hope revived in Neb\xe2\x80\x99s heart. He undressed his master\r\n'b'to see if he was wounded, but not so much as a bruise was to be found,\r\n'b'either on the head, body, or limbs, which was surprising, as he must\r\n'b'have been dashed against the rocks; even the hands were uninjured, and\r\n'b'it was difficult to explain how the engineer showed no traces of the\r\n'b'efforts which he must have made to get out of reach of the breakers.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the explanation would come later. When Cyrus was able to speak he\r\n'b'would say what had happened. For the present the question was, how to\r\n'b'recall him to life, and it appeared likely that rubbing would bring this\r\n'b'about; so they set to work with the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s jersey.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer, revived by this rude shampooing, moved his arm slightly\r\n'b'and began to breathe more regularly. He was sinking from exhaustion,\r\n'b'and certainly, had not the reporter and his companions arrived, it would\r\n'b'have been all over with Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou thought your master was dead, didn\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d said the seaman to Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! quite dead!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cand if Top had not found you, and\r\n'b'brought you here, I should have buried my master, and then have lain\r\n'b'down on his grave to die!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It had indeed been a narrow escape for Cyrus Harding!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb then recounted what had happened. The day before, after having\r\n'b'left the Chimneys at daybreak, he had ascended the coast in a northerly\r\n'b'direction, and had reached that part of the shore which he had already\r\n'b'visited.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There, without any hope he acknowledged, Neb had searched the beach,\r\n'b'among the rocks, on the sand, for the smallest trace to guide him. He\r\n'b'examined particularly that part of the beach which was not covered by\r\n'b'the high tide, for near the sea the water would have obliterated all\r\n'b'marks. Neb did not expect to find his master living. It was for a corpse\r\n'b'that he searched, a corpse which he wished to bury with his own hands!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He sought long in vain. This desert coast appeared never to have been\r\n'b'visited by a human creature. The shells, those which the sea had not\r\n'b'reached, and which might be met with by millions above high-water mark,\r\n'b'were untouched. Not a shell was broken.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb then resolved to walk along the beach for some miles. It was\r\n'b'possible that the waves had carried the body to quite a distant point.\r\n'b'When a corpse floats a little distance from a low shore, it rarely\r\n'b'happens that the tide does not throw it up, sooner or later. This Neb\r\n'b'knew, and he wished to see his master again for the last time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI went along the coast for another two miles, carefully examining\r\n'b'the beach, both at high and low water, and I had despaired of finding\r\n'b'anything, when yesterday, above five in the evening, I saw footprints on\r\n'b'the sand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFootprints?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDid these footprints begin at the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb, \xe2\x80\x9conly above high-water mark, for the others must have\r\n'b'been washed out by the tide.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGo on, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI went half crazy when I saw these footprints. They were very clear\r\n'b'and went towards the downs. I followed them for a quarter of a mile,\r\n'b'running, but taking care not to destroy them. Five minutes after, as\r\n'b'it was getting dark, I heard the barking of a dog. It was Top, and Top\r\n'b'brought me here, to my master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb ended his account by saying what had been his grief at finding the\r\n'b'inanimate body, in which he vainly sought for the least sign of life.\r\n'b'Now that he had found him dead he longed for him to be alive. All his\r\n'b'efforts were useless! Nothing remained to be done but to render the last\r\n'b'duties to the one whom he had loved so much! Neb then thought of his\r\n'b'companions. They, no doubt, would wish to see the unfortunate man again.\r\n'b'Top was there. Could he not rely on the sagacity of the faithful animal?\r\n'b'Neb several times pronounced the name of the reporter, the one among his\r\n'b'companions whom Top knew best.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then he pointed to the south, and the dog bounded off in the direction\r\n'b'indicated to him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'We have heard how, guided by an instinct which might be looked upon\r\n'b'almost as supernatural, Top had found them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb\xe2\x80\x99s companions had listened with great attention to this account.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was unaccountable to them how Cyrus Harding, after the efforts which\r\n'b'he must have made to escape from the waves by crossing the rocks, had\r\n'b'not received even a scratch. And what could not be explained either was\r\n'b'how the engineer had managed to get to this cave in the downs, more than\r\n'b'a mile from the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cit was not you who brought your master to\r\n'b'this place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, it was not I,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the Negro.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s very clear that the captain came here by himself,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is clear in reality,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is not credible!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The explanation of this fact could only be produced from the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'own lips, and they must wait for that till speech returned. Rubbing had\r\n'b're-established the circulation of the blood. Cyrus Harding moved his arm\r\n'b'again, then his head, and a few incomprehensible words escaped him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb, who was bending over him, spoke, but the engineer did not appear\r\n'b'to hear, and his eyes remained closed. Life was only exhibited in him by\r\n'b'movement, his senses had not as yet been restored.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft much regretted not having either fire, or the means of\r\n'b'procuring it, for he had, unfortunately, forgotten to bring the burnt\r\n'b'linen, which would easily have ignited from the sparks produced by\r\n'b'striking together two flints. As to the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s pockets, they were\r\n'b'entirely empty, except that of his waistcoat, which contained his watch.\r\n'b'It was necessary to carry Harding to the Chimneys, and that as soon as\r\n'b'possible. This was the opinion of all.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, the care which was lavished on the engineer brought him back\r\n'b'to consciousness sooner than they could have expected. The water with\r\n'b'which they wetted his lips revived him gradually. Pencroft also thought\r\n'b'of mixing with the water some moisture from the titra\xe2\x80\x99s flesh which\r\n'b'he had brought. Herbert ran to the beach and returned with two large\r\n'b'bivalve shells. The sailor concocted something which he introduced\r\n'b'between the lips of the engineer, who eagerly drinking it opened his\r\n'b'eyes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb and the reporter were leaning over him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy master! my master!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer heard him. He recognized Neb and Spilett, then his other\r\n'b'two companions, and his hand slightly pressed theirs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few words again escaped him, which showed what thoughts were, even\r\n'b'then, troubling his brain. This time he was understood. Undoubtedly they\r\n'b'were the same words he had before attempted to utter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIsland or continent?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBother the continent,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft hastily; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is time enough\r\n'b'to see about that, captain! we don\xe2\x80\x99t care for anything, provided you are\r\n'b'living.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer nodded faintly, and then appeared to sleep.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They respected this sleep, and the reporter began immediately to make\r\n'b'arrangements for transporting Harding to a more comfortable place. Neb,\r\n'b'Herbert, and Pencroft left the cave and directed their steps towards\r\n'b'a high mound crowned with a few distorted trees. On the way the sailor\r\n'b'could not help repeating,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIsland or continent! To think of that, when at one\xe2\x80\x99s last gasp! What a\r\n'b'man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Arrived at the summit of the mound, Pencroft and his two companions\r\n'b'set to work, with no other tools than their hands, to despoil of its\r\n'b'principal branches a rather sickly tree, a sort of marine fir; with\r\n'b'these branches they made a litter, on which, covered with grass and\r\n'b'leaves, they could carry the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This occupied them nearly forty minutes, and it was ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock when\r\n'b'they returned to Cyrus Harding whom Spilett had not left.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer was just awaking from the sleep, or rather from the\r\n'b'drowsiness, in which they had found him. The color was returning to his\r\n'b'cheeks, which till now had been as pale as death. He raised himself a\r\n'b'little, looked around him, and appeared to ask where he was.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCan you listen to me without fatigue, Cyrus?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt\xe2\x80\x99s my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Captain Harding will be\r\n'b'able to listen to you still better, if he will have some more grouse\r\n'b'jelly,--for we have grouse, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, presenting him with a\r\n'b'little of this jelly, to which he this time added some of the flesh.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding ate a little of the grouse, and the rest was divided\r\n'b'among his companions, who found it but a meager breakfast, for they were\r\n'b'suffering extremely from hunger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is plenty of food at the Chimneys, for\r\n'b'you must know, captain, that down there, in the south, we have a house,\r\n'b'with rooms, beds, and fireplace, and in the pantry, several dozen of\r\n'b'birds, which our Herbert calls couroucous. Your litter is ready, and as\r\n'b'soon as you feel strong enough we will carry you home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cwait another hour or two,\r\n'b'and then we will set out. And now speak, Spilett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter then told him all that had occurred. He recounted all the\r\n'b'events with which Cyrus was unacquainted, the last fall of the balloon,\r\n'b'the landing on this unknown land, which appeared a desert (whatever it\r\n'b'was, whether island or continent), the discovery of the Chimneys,\r\n'b'the search for him, not forgetting of course Neb\xe2\x80\x99s devotion, the\r\n'b'intelligence exhibited by the faithful Top, as well as many other\r\n'b'matters.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding, in a still feeble voice, \xe2\x80\x9cyou did not, then, pick\r\n'b'me up on the beach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd did you not bring me to this cave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt what distance is this cave from the sea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a mile,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cand if you are astonished, captain,\r\n'b'we are not less surprised ourselves at seeing you in this place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, who was recovering gradually, and who took\r\n'b'great interest in these details, \xe2\x80\x9cindeed it is very singular!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you tell us what happened after you were\r\n'b'carried off by the sea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding considered. He knew very little. The wave had torn him\r\n'b'from the balloon net. He sank at first several fathoms. On returning\r\n'b'to the surface, in the half light, he felt a living creature struggling\r\n'b'near him. It was Top, who had sprung to his help. He saw nothing of the\r\n'b'balloon, which, lightened both of his weight and that of the dog, had\r\n'b'darted away like an arrow.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There he was, in the midst of the angry sea, at a distance which could\r\n'b'not be less than half a mile from the shore. He attempted to struggle\r\n'b'against the billows by swimming vigorously. Top held him up by his\r\n'b'clothes; but a strong current seized him and drove him towards the\r\n'b'north, and after half an hour of exertion, he sank, dragging Top\r\n'b'with him into the depths. From that moment to the moment in which he\r\n'b'recovered to find himself in the arms of his friends he remembered\r\n'b'nothing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must have been thrown on to the\r\n'b'beach, and you must have had strength to walk here, since Neb found your\r\n'b'footmarks!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes... of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, thoughtfully; \xe2\x80\x9cand you found\r\n'b'no traces of human beings on this coast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot a trace,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter; \xe2\x80\x9cbesides, if by chance you had met\r\n'b'with some deliverer there, just in the nick of time, why should he have\r\n'b'abandoned you after having saved you from the waves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, my dear Spilett. Tell me, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d added the engineer,\r\n'b'turning to his servant, \xe2\x80\x9cit was not you who... you can\xe2\x80\x99t have had a\r\n'b'moment of unconsciousness... during which no, that\xe2\x80\x99s absurd.... Do any\r\n'b'of the footsteps still remain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, master,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb; \xe2\x80\x9chere, at the entrance, at the back of\r\n'b'the mound, in a place sheltered from the rain and wind. The storm has\r\n'b'destroyed the others.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you take my shoe and see if it\r\n'b'fits exactly to the footprints?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor did as the engineer requested. While he and Herbert, guided\r\n'b'by Neb, went to the place where the footprints were to be found, Cyrus\r\n'b'remarked to the reporter,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a most extraordinary thing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly inexplicable!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut do not dwell upon it just now, my dear Spilett, we will talk about\r\n'b'it by-and-by.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A moment after the others entered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no doubt about it. The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s shoe fitted exactly to the\r\n'b'footmarks. It was therefore Cyrus Harding who had left them on the sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI must have experienced this unconsciousness which I\r\n'b'attributed to Neb. I must have walked like a somnambulist, without any\r\n'b'knowledge of my steps, and Top must have guided me here, after having\r\n'b'dragged me from the waves... Come, Top! Come, old dog!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The magnificent animal bounded barking to his master, and caresses were\r\n'b'lavished on him. It was agreed that there was no other way of accounting\r\n'b'for the rescue of Cyrus Harding, and that Top deserved all the honor of\r\n'b'the affair.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Pencroft having asked the engineer if they could\r\n'b'now remove him, Harding, instead of replying, and by an effort which\r\n'b'exhibited the most energetic will, got up. But he was obliged to lean on\r\n'b'the sailor, or he would have fallen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell done!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cbring the captain\xe2\x80\x99s litter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The litter was brought; the transverse branches had been covered with\r\n'b'leaves and long grass. Harding was laid on it, and Pencroft, having\r\n'b'taken his place at one end and Neb at the other, they started towards\r\n'b'the coast. There was a distance of eight miles to be accomplished; but,\r\n'b'as they could not go fast, and it would perhaps be necessary to stop\r\n'b'frequently, they reckoned that it would take at least six hours to reach\r\n'b'the Chimneys. The wind was still strong, but fortunately it did not\r\n'b'rain. Although lying down, the engineer, leaning on his elbow, observed\r\n'b'the coast, particularly inland. He did not speak, but he gazed; and, no\r\n'b'doubt, the appearance of the country, with its inequalities of ground,\r\n'b'its forests, its various productions, were impressed on his mind.\r\n'b'However, after traveling for two hours, fatigue overcame him, and he\r\n'b'slept.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At half-past five the little band arrived at the precipice, and a short\r\n'b'time after at the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They stopped, and the litter was placed on the sand; Cyrus Harding was\r\n'b'sleeping profoundly, and did not awake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, to his extreme surprise, found that the terrible storm had\r\n'b'quite altered the aspect of the place. Important changes had occurred;\r\n'b'great blocks of stone lay on the beach, which was also covered with a\r\n'b'thick carpet of sea-weed, algae, and wrack. Evidently the sea, passing\r\n'b'over the islet, had been carried right up to the foot of the enormous\r\n'b'curtain of granite. The soil in front of the cave had been torn away\r\n'b'by the violence of the waves. A horrid presentiment flashed across\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s mind. He rushed into the passage, but returned almost\r\n'b'immediately, and stood motionless, staring at his companions.... The\r\n'b'fire was out; the drowned cinders were nothing but mud; the burnt\r\n'b'linen, which was to have served as tinder, had disappeared! The sea had\r\n'b'penetrated to the end of the passages, and everything was overthrown and\r\n'b'destroyed in the interior of the Chimneys!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 9\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few words, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb were made acquainted\r\n'b'with what had happened. This accident, which appeared so very serious\r\n'b'to Pencroft, produced different effects on the companions of the honest\r\n'b'sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb, in his delight at having found his master, did not listen, or\r\n'b'rather, did not care to trouble himself with what Pencroft was saying.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert shared in some degree the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s feelings.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the reporter, he simply replied,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word, Pencroft, it\xe2\x80\x99s perfectly indifferent to me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, I repeat, that we haven\xe2\x80\x99t any fire!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNor any means of relighting it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I say, Mr. Spilett--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t Cyrus here?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs not our engineer alive? He will soon find some way of making fire\r\n'b'for us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What had Pencroft to say? He could say nothing, for, in the bottom of\r\n'b'his heart he shared the confidence which his companions had in Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding. The engineer was to them a microcosm, a compound of every\r\n'b'science, a possessor of all human knowledge. It was better to be with\r\n'b'Cyrus in a desert island, than without him in the most flourishing town\r\n'b'in the United States. With him they could want nothing; with him they\r\n'b'would never despair. If these brave men had been told that a volcanic\r\n'b'eruption would destroy the land, that this land would be engulfed in the\r\n'b'depths of the Pacific, they would have imperturbably replied,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCyrus is here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While in the palanquin, however, the engineer had again relapsed into\r\n'b'unconsciousness, which the jolting to which he had been subjected during\r\n'b'his journey had brought on, so that they could not now appeal to his\r\n'b'ingenuity. The supper must necessarily be very meager. In fact, all the\r\n'b'grouse flesh had been consumed, and there no longer existed any means of\r\n'b'cooking more game. Besides, the couroucous which had been reserved had\r\n'b'disappeared. They must consider what was to be done.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'First of all, Cyrus Harding was carried into the central passage. There\r\n'b'they managed to arrange for him a couch of sea-weed which still remained\r\n'b'almost dry. The deep sleep which had overpowered him would no doubt be\r\n'b'more beneficial to him than any nourishment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Night had closed in, and the temperature, which had modified when the\r\n'b'wind shifted to the northwest, again became extremely cold. Also, the\r\n'b'sea having destroyed the partitions which Pencroft had put up in certain\r\n'b'places in the passages, the Chimneys, on account of the draughts, had\r\n'b'become scarcely habitable. The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s condition would, therefore,\r\n'b'have been bad enough, if his companions had not carefully covered him\r\n'b'with their coats and waistcoats.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Supper, this evening, was of course composed of the inevitable\r\n'b'lithodomes, of which Herbert and Neb picked up a plentiful supply on the\r\n'b'beach. However, to these molluscs, the lad added some edible sea-weed,\r\n'b'which he gathered on high rocks, whose sides were only washed by the sea\r\n'b'at the time of high tides. This sea-weed, which belongs to the order\r\n'b'of Fucacae, of the genus Sargassum, produces, when dry, a gelatinous\r\n'b'matter, rich and nutritious. The reporter and his companions, after\r\n'b'having eaten a quantity of lithodomes, sucked the sargassum, of which\r\n'b'the taste was very tolerable. It is used in parts of the East very\r\n'b'considerably by the natives. \xe2\x80\x9cNever mind!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthe captain\r\n'b'will help us soon.\xe2\x80\x9d Meanwhile the cold became very severe, and unhappily\r\n'b'they had no means of defending themselves from it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor, extremely vexed, tried in all sorts of ways to procure fire.\r\n'b'Neb helped him in this work. He found some dry moss, and by striking\r\n'b'together two pebbles he obtained some sparks, but the moss, not being\r\n'b'inflammable enough, did not take fire, for the sparks were really only\r\n'b'incandescent, and not at all of the same consistency as those which\r\n'b'are emitted from flint when struck in the same manner. The experiment,\r\n'b'therefore, did not succeed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, although he had no confidence in the proceeding, then tried\r\n'b'rubbing two pieces of dry wood together, as savages do. Certainly, the\r\n'b'movement which he and Neb exhibited, if it had been transformed into\r\n'b'heat, according to the new theory, would have been enough to heat the\r\n'b'boiler of a steamer! It came to nothing. The bits of wood became hot, to\r\n'b'be sure, but much less so than the operators themselves.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After working an hour, Pencroft, who was in a complete state of\r\n'b'perspiration, threw down the pieces of wood in disgust.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can never be made to believe that savages light their fires in this\r\n'b'way, let them say what they will,\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cI could sooner light\r\n'b'my arms by rubbing them against each other!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor was wrong to despise the proceeding. Savages often kindle\r\n'b'wood by means of rapid rubbing. But every sort of wood does not answer\r\n'b'for the purpose, and besides, there is \xe2\x80\x9cthe knack,\xe2\x80\x9d following the usual\r\n'b'expression, and it is probable that Pencroft had not \xe2\x80\x9cthe knack.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s ill humor did not last long. Herbert had taken the bits of\r\n'b'wood which he had turned down, and was exerting himself to rub them.\r\n'b'The hardy sailor could not restrain a burst of laughter on seeing the\r\n'b'efforts of the lad to succeed where he had failed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRub, my boy, rub!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am rubbing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I don\xe2\x80\x99t pretend to do\r\n'b'anything else but warm myself instead of shivering, and soon I shall be\r\n'b'as hot as you are, my good Pencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This soon happened. However, they were obliged to give up, for this\r\n'b'night at least, the attempt to procure fire. Gideon Spilett repeated,\r\n'b'for the twentieth time, that Cyrus Harding would not have been troubled\r\n'b'for so small a difficulty. And, in the meantime, he stretched himself in\r\n'b'one of the passages on his bed of sand. Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft did\r\n'b'the same, while Top slept at his master\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Next day, the 28th of March, when the engineer awoke, about eight in the\r\n'b'morning, he saw his companions around him watching his sleep, and, as on\r\n'b'the day before, his first words were:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIsland or continent?\xe2\x80\x9d This was his uppermost thought.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwe don\xe2\x80\x99t know anything about it, captain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t know yet?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut we shall know,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen you have guided us into\r\n'b'the country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think I am able to try it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, who, without much\r\n'b'effort, rose and stood upright.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s capital!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI feel dreadfully weak,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cGive me something to eat, my\r\n'b'friends, and it will soon go off. You have fire, haven\xe2\x80\x99t you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This question was not immediately replied to. But, in a few seconds--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! we have no fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cor rather, captain, we have it\r\n'b'no longer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor recounted all that had passed the day before. He amused\r\n'b'the engineer by the history of the single match, then his abortive\r\n'b'attempt to procure fire in the savages\xe2\x80\x99 way.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall consider,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand if we do not find some\r\n'b'substance similar to tinder--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will make matches.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cChemicals?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cChemicals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not more difficult than that,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the reporter, striking the\r\n'b'sailor on the shoulder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The latter did not think it so simple, but he did not protest. All went\r\n'b'out. The weather had become very fine. The sun was rising from the sea\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'horizon, and touched with golden spangles the prismatic rugosities of\r\n'b'the huge precipice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Having thrown a rapid glance around him, the engineer seated himself on\r\n'b'a block of stone. Herbert offered him a few handfuls of shell-fish and\r\n'b'sargassum, saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all that we have, Captain Harding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThanks, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cit will do--for this morning at\r\n'b'least.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He ate the wretched food with appetite, and washed it down with a little\r\n'b'fresh water, drawn from the river in an immense shell.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His companions looked at him without speaking. Then, feeling somewhat\r\n'b'refreshed, Cyrus Harding crossed his arms, and said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo, my friends, you do not know yet whether fate has thrown us on an\r\n'b'island, or on a continent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the boy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall know to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9ctill then, there is\r\n'b'nothing to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFire,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, who, also, had a fixed idea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will make it, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhile you were carrying me yesterday, did I not see in the west a\r\n'b'mountain which commands the country?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9ca mountain which must be rather high--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will climb to the summit to-morrow,\r\n'b'and then we shall see if this land is an island or a continent. Till\r\n'b'then, I repeat, there is nothing to be done.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, fire!\xe2\x80\x9d said the obstinate sailor again.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut he will make us a fire!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9conly have a\r\n'b'little patience, Pencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The seaman looked at Spilett in a way which seemed to say, \xe2\x80\x9cIf it\r\n'b'depended upon you to do it, we wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t taste roast meat very soon\xe2\x80\x9d; but\r\n'b'he was silent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile Captain Harding had made no reply. He appeared to be very\r\n'b'little troubled by the question of fire. For a few minutes he remained\r\n'b'absorbed in thought; then again speaking,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cour situation is, perhaps, deplorable; but, at\r\n'b'any rate, it is very plain. Either we are on a continent, and then, at\r\n'b'the expense of greater or less fatigue, we shall reach some inhabited\r\n'b'place, or we are on an island. In the latter case, if the island is\r\n'b'inhabited, we will try to get out of the scrape with the help of its\r\n'b'inhabitants; if it is desert, we will try to get out of the scrape by\r\n'b'ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, nothing could be plainer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, whether it is an island or a continent,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cwhereabouts do you think, Cyrus, this storm has thrown us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I presume it is\r\n'b'some land in the Pacific. In fact, when we left Richmond, the wind was\r\n'b'blowing from the northeast, and its very violence greatly proves that\r\n'b'it could not have varied. If the direction has been maintained from\r\n'b'the northeast to the southwest, we have traversed the States of North\r\n'b'Carolina, of South Carolina, of Georgia, the Gulf of Mexico, Mexico,\r\n'b'itself, in its narrow part, then a part of the Pacific Ocean. I cannot\r\n'b'estimate the distance traversed by the balloon at less than six to seven\r\n'b'thousand miles, and, even supposing that the wind had varied half a\r\n'b'quarter, it must have brought us either to the archipelago of Mendava,\r\n'b'either on the Pomotous, or even, if it had a greater strength than I\r\n'b'suppose, to the land of New Zealand. If the last hypothesis is correct,\r\n'b'it will be easy enough to get home again. English or Maoris, we shall\r\n'b'always find some one to whom we can speak. If, on the contrary, this is\r\n'b'the coast of a desert island in some tiny archipelago, perhaps we shall\r\n'b'be able to reconnoiter it from the summit of that peak which overlooks\r\n'b'the country, and then we shall see how best to establish ourselves here\r\n'b'as if we are never to go away.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cYou say \xe2\x80\x98Never,\xe2\x80\x99 my dear Cyrus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBetter to put things at the worst at first,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\n'b'reserve the best for a surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell said,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is to be hoped, too, that this\r\n'b'island, if it be one, is not situated just out of the course of ships;\r\n'b'that would be really unlucky!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall not know what we have to rely on until we have first made the\r\n'b'ascent of the mountain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut to-morrow, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cshall you be in a state to\r\n'b'bear the fatigue of the ascent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cprovided you and Pencroft, my boy,\r\n'b'show yourselves quick and clever hunters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9csince you are speaking of game, if on my\r\n'b'return, I was as certain of roasting it as I am of bringing it back--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBring it back all the same, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was then agreed that the engineer and the reporter were to pass the\r\n'b'day at the Chimneys, so as to examine the shore and the upper plateau.\r\n'b'Neb, Herbert, and the sailor were to return to the forest, renew their\r\n'b'store of wood, and lay violent hands on every creature, feathered or\r\n'b'hairy, which might come within their reach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They set out accordingly about ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, Herbert\r\n'b'confident, Neb joyous, Pencroft murmuring aside,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf, on my return, I find a fire at the house, I shall believe that\r\n'b'the thunder itself came to light it.\xe2\x80\x9d All three climbed the bank; and\r\n'b'arrived at the angle made by the river, the sailor, stopping, said to\r\n'b'his two companions,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShall we begin by being hunters or wood-men?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHunters,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is Top already in quest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will hunt, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand afterwards we can come back\r\n'b'and collect our wood.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This agreed to, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, after having torn three\r\n'b'sticks from the trunk of a young fir, followed Top, who was bounding\r\n'b'about among the long grass.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This time, the hunters, instead of following the course of the river,\r\n'b'plunged straight into the heart of the forest. There were still the\r\n'b'same trees, belonging, for the most part, to the pine family. In\r\n'b'certain places, less crowded, growing in clumps, these pines exhibited\r\n'b'considerable dimensions, and appeared to indicate, by their development,\r\n'b'that the country was situated in a higher latitude than the engineer had\r\n'b'supposed. Glades, bristling with stumps worn away by time, were covered\r\n'b'with dry wood, which formed an inexhaustible store of fuel. Then,\r\n'b'the glade passed, the underwood thickened again, and became almost\r\n'b'impenetrable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was difficult enough to find the way among the groups of trees,\r\n'b'without any beaten track. So the sailor from time to time broke off\r\n'b'branches which might be easily recognized. But, perhaps, he was wrong\r\n'b'not to follow the watercourse, as he and Herbert had done on their first\r\n'b'excursion, for after walking an hour not a creature had shown itself.\r\n'b'Top, running under the branches, only roused birds which could not be\r\n'b'approached. Even the couroucous were invisible, and it was probable that\r\n'b'the sailor would be obliged to return to the marshy part of the forest,\r\n'b'in which he had so happily performed his grouse fishing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, in a slightly sarcastic tone, \xe2\x80\x9cif this is\r\n'b'all the game which you promised to bring back to my master, it won\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n'b'need a large fire to roast it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave patience,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cit isn\xe2\x80\x99t the game which will be\r\n'b'wanting on our return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave you not confidence in Captain Harding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut you don\xe2\x80\x99t believe that he will make fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI shall believe it when the wood is blazing in the fireplace.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will blaze, since my master has said so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, the sun had not reached the highest point in its course above\r\n'b'the horizon. The exploration, therefore, continued, and was usefully\r\n'b'marked by a discovery which Herbert made of a tree whose fruit was\r\n'b'edible. This was the stone-pine, which produces an excellent almond,\r\n'b'very much esteemed in the temperate regions of America and Europe. These\r\n'b'almonds were in a perfect state of maturity, and Herbert described them\r\n'b'to his companions, who feasted on them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9csea-weed by way of bread, raw mussels for meat,\r\n'b'and almonds for dessert, that\xe2\x80\x99s certainly a good dinner for those who\r\n'b'have not a single match in their pocket!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe mustn\xe2\x80\x99t complain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not complaining, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9conly I repeat, that\r\n'b'meat is a little too much economized in this sort of meal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop has found something!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb, who ran towards a thicket, in the\r\n'b'midst of which the dog had disappeared, barking. With Top\xe2\x80\x99s barking were\r\n'b'mingled curious gruntings.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor and Herbert had followed Neb. If there was game there this\r\n'b'was not the time to discuss how it was to be cooked, but rather, how\r\n'b'they were to get hold of it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The hunters had scarcely entered the bushes when they saw Top engaged\r\n'b'in a struggle with an animal which he was holding by the ear. This\r\n'b'quadruped was a sort of pig nearly two feet and a half long, of a\r\n'b'blackish brown color, lighter below, having hard scanty hair; its toes,\r\n'b'then strongly fixed in the ground, seemed to be united by a membrane.\r\n'b'Herbert recognized in this animal the capybara, that is to say, one of\r\n'b'the largest members of the rodent order.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, the capybara did not struggle against the dog. It stupidly\r\n'b'rolled its eyes, deeply buried in a thick bed of fat. Perhaps it saw men\r\n'b'for the first time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, Neb having tightened his grasp on his stick, was just going to\r\n'b'fell the pig, when the latter, tearing itself from Top\xe2\x80\x99s teeth, by which\r\n'b'it was only held by the tip of its ear, uttered a vigorous grunt, rushed\r\n'b'upon Herbert, almost overthrew him, and disappeared in the wood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe rascal!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All three directly darted after Top, but at the moment when they joined\r\n'b'him the animal had disappeared under the waters of a large pond shaded\r\n'b'by venerable pines.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft stopped, motionless. Top plunged into the\r\n'b'water, but the capybara, hidden at the bottom of the pond, did not\r\n'b'appear.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said the boy, \xe2\x80\x9cfor he will soon come to the surface to\r\n'b'breathe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWon\xe2\x80\x99t he drown?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9csince he has webbed feet, and is almost an\r\n'b'amphibious animal. But watch him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top remained in the water. Pencroft and his two companions went to\r\n'b'different parts of the bank, so as to cut off the retreat of the\r\n'b'capybara, which the dog was looking for beneath the water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert was not mistaken. In a few minutes the animal appeared on the\r\n'b'surface of the water. Top was upon it in a bound, and kept it from\r\n'b'plunging again. An instant later the capybara, dragged to the bank, was\r\n'b'killed by a blow from Neb\xe2\x80\x99s stick.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, who was always ready with this cry of triumph.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGive me but a good fire, and this pig shall be gnawed to the bones!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft hoisted the capybara on his shoulders, and judging by the\r\n'b'height of the sun that it was about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock, he gave the signal to\r\n'b'return.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top\xe2\x80\x99s instinct was useful to the hunters, who, thanks to the intelligent\r\n'b'animal, were enabled to discover the road by which they had come. Half\r\n'b'an hour later they arrived at the river.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft soon made a raft of wood, as he had done before, though if\r\n'b'there was no fire it would be a useless task, and the raft following the\r\n'b'current, they returned towards the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the sailor had not gone fifty paces when he stopped, and again\r\n'b'uttering a tremendous hurrah, pointed towards the angle of the cliff,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert! Neb! Look!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Smoke was escaping and curling up among the rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 10\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few minutes the three hunters were before a crackling fire. The\r\n'b'captain and the reporter were there. Pencroft looked from one to the\r\n'b'other, his capybara in his hand, without saying a word.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, yes, my brave fellow,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFire, real fire, which will roast this splendid pig perfectly, and we\r\n'b'will have a feast presently!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut who lighted it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe sun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett was quite right in his reply. It was the sun which\r\n'b'had furnished the heat which so astonished Pencroft. The sailor could\r\n'b'scarcely believe his eyes, and he was so amazed that he did not think of\r\n'b'questioning the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHad you a burning-glass, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert of Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I made one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And he showed the apparatus which served for a burning-glass. It was\r\n'b'simply two glasses which he had taken from his own and the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'watches. Having filled them with water and rendered their edges adhesive\r\n'b'by means of a little clay, he thus fabricated a regular burning-glass,\r\n'b'which, concentrating the solar rays on some very dry moss, soon caused\r\n'b'it to blaze.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor considered the apparatus; then he gazed at the engineer\r\n'b'without saying a word, only a look plainly expressed his opinion that if\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding was not a magician, he was certainly no ordinary man. At\r\n'b'last speech returned to him, and he cried,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNote that, Mr. Spilett, note that down on your paper!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is noted,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, Neb helping him, the seaman arranged the spit, and the capybara,\r\n'b'properly cleaned, was soon roasting like a suckling-pig before a clear,\r\n'b'crackling fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The Chimneys had again become more habitable, not only because the\r\n'b'passages were warmed by the fire, but because the partitions of wood and\r\n'b'mud had been re-established.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was evident that the engineer and his companions had employed their\r\n'b'day well. Cyrus Harding had almost entirely recovered his strength, and\r\n'b'had proved it by climbing to the upper plateau. From this point his eye,\r\n'b'accustomed to estimate heights and distances, was fixed for a long time\r\n'b'on the cone, the summit of which he wished to reach the next day. The\r\n'b'mountain, situated about six miles to the northwest, appeared to him to\r\n'b'measure 3,500 feet above the level of the sea. Consequently the gaze of\r\n'b'an observer posted on its summit would extend over a radius of at least\r\n'b'fifty miles. Therefore it was probable that Harding could easily solve\r\n'b'the question of \xe2\x80\x9cisland or continent,\xe2\x80\x9d to which he attached so much\r\n'b'importance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They supped capitally. The flesh of the capybara was declared excellent.\r\n'b'The sargassum and the almonds of the stone-pine completed the repast,\r\n'b'during which the engineer spoke little. He was preoccupied with projects\r\n'b'for the next day.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Once or twice Pencroft gave forth some ideas upon what it would be best\r\n'b'to do; but Cyrus Harding, who was evidently of a methodical mind, only\r\n'b'shook his head without uttering a word.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall know what we have to depend upon,\r\n'b'and we will act accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The meal ended, fresh armfuls of wood were thrown on the fire, and\r\n'b'the inhabitants of the Chimneys, including the faithful Top, were soon\r\n'b'buried in a deep sleep.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No incident disturbed this peaceful night, and the next day, the 29th\r\n'b'of March, fresh and active they awoke, ready to undertake the excursion\r\n'b'which must determine their fate.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All was ready for the start. The remains of the capybara would be enough\r\n'b'to sustain Harding and his companions for at least twenty-four hours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Besides, they hoped to find more food on the way. As the glasses had\r\n'b'been returned to the watches of the engineer and reporter, Pencroft\r\n'b'burned a little linen to serve as tinder. As to flint, that would not be\r\n'b'wanting in these regions of Plutonic origin. It was half-past seven in\r\n'b'the morning when the explorers, armed with sticks, left the Chimneys.\r\n'b'Following Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s advice, it appeared best to take the road already\r\n'b'traversed through the forest, and to return by another route. It was\r\n'b'also the most direct way to reach the mountain. They turned the south\r\n'b'angle and followed the left bank of the river, which was abandoned at\r\n'b'the point where it formed an elbow towards the southwest. The path,\r\n'b'already trodden under the evergreen trees, was found, and at nine\r\n'b'o\xe2\x80\x99clock Cyrus Harding and his companions had reached the western border\r\n'b'of the forest. The ground, till then, very little undulated, boggy at\r\n'b'first, dry and sandy afterwards, had a gentle slope, which ascended from\r\n'b'the shore towards the interior of the country. A few very timid animals\r\n'b'were seen under the forest-trees. Top quickly started them, but his\r\n'b'master soon called him back, for the time had not come to commence\r\n'b'hunting; that would be attended to later. The engineer was not a man who\r\n'b'would allow himself to be diverted from his fixed idea. It might even\r\n'b'have been said that he did not observe the country at all, either in\r\n'b'its configuration or in its natural productions, his great aim being\r\n'b'to climb the mountain before him, and therefore straight towards it he\r\n'b'went. At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock a halt of a few minutes was made. On leaving\r\n'b'the forest, the mountain system of the country appeared before the\r\n'b'explorers. The mountain was composed of two cones; the first, truncated\r\n'b'at a height of about two thousand five hundred feet, was sustained by\r\n'b'buttresses, which appeared to branch out like the talons of an immense\r\n'b'claw set on the ground. Between these were narrow valleys, bristling\r\n'b'with trees, the last clumps of which rose to the top of the lowest cone.\r\n'b'There appeared to be less vegetation on that side of the mountain which\r\n'b'was exposed to the northeast, and deep fissures could be seen which, no\r\n'b'doubt, were watercourses.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the first cone rested a second, slightly rounded, and placed a little\r\n'b'on one side, like a great round hat cocked over the ear. A Scotchman\r\n'b'would have said, \xe2\x80\x9cHis bonnet was a thocht ajee.\xe2\x80\x9d It appeared formed of\r\n'b'bare earth, here and there pierced by reddish rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They wished to reach the second cone, and proceeding along the ridge of\r\n'b'the spurs seemed to be the best way by which to gain it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are on volcanic ground,\xe2\x80\x9d Cyrus Harding had said, and his companions\r\n'b'following him began to ascend by degrees on the back of a spur, which,\r\n'b'by a winding and consequently more accessible path, joined the first\r\n'b'plateau.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The ground had evidently been convulsed by subterranean force. Here and\r\n'b'there stray blocks, numerous debris of basalt and pumice-stone, were met\r\n'b'with. In isolated groups rose fir-trees, which, some hundred feet\r\n'b'lower, at the bottom of the narrow gorges, formed massive shades almost\r\n'b'impenetrable to the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the first part of the ascent, Herbert remarked on the footprints\r\n'b'which indicated the recent passage of large animals.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps these beasts will not let us pass by willingly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, who had already hunted the tiger in\r\n'b'India, and the lion in Africa, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall soon learn how successfully to\r\n'b'encounter them. But in the meantime we must be upon our guard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They ascended but slowly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The distance, increased by detours and obstacles which could not be\r\n'b'surmounted directly, was long. Sometimes, too, the ground suddenly fell,\r\n'b'and they found themselves on the edge of a deep chasm which they had to\r\n'b'go round. Thus, in retracing their steps so as to find some practicable\r\n'b'path, much time was employed and fatigue undergone for nothing. At\r\n'b'twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when the small band of adventurers halted for breakfast\r\n'b'at the foot of a large group of firs, near a little stream which fell in\r\n'b'cascades, they found themselves still half way from the first plateau,\r\n'b'which most probably they would not reach till nightfall. From this\r\n'b'point the view of the sea was much extended, but on the right the high\r\n'b'promontory prevented their seeing whether there was land beyond it. On\r\n'b'the left, the sight extended several miles to the north; but, on the\r\n'b'northwest, at the point occupied by the explorers, it was cut short\r\n'b'by the ridge of a fantastically-shaped spur, which formed a powerful\r\n'b'support of the central cone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At one o\xe2\x80\x99clock the ascent was continued. They slanted more towards the\r\n'b'southwest and again entered among thick bushes. There under the shade\r\n'b'of the trees fluttered several couples of gallinaceae belonging to the\r\n'b'pheasant species. They were tragopans, ornamented by a pendant skin\r\n'b'which hangs over their throats, and by two small, round horns, planted\r\n'b'behind the eyes. Among these birds, which were about the size of a fowl,\r\n'b'the female was uniformly brown, while the male was gorgeous in his\r\n'b'red plumage, decorated with white spots. Gideon Spilett, with a stone\r\n'b'cleverly and vigorously thrown, killed one of these tragopans, on which\r\n'b'Pencroft, made hungry by the fresh air, had cast greedy eyes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After leaving the region of bushes, the party, assisted by resting on\r\n'b'each other\xe2\x80\x99s shoulders, climbed for about a hundred feet up a steep\r\n'b'acclivity and reached a level place, with very few trees, where the soil\r\n'b'appeared volcanic. It was necessary to ascend by zigzags to make\r\n'b'the slope more easy, for it was very steep, and the footing being\r\n'b'exceedingly precarious required the greatest caution. Neb and Herbert\r\n'b'took the lead, Pencroft the rear, the captain and the reporter between\r\n'b'them. The animals which frequented these heights--and there were\r\n'b'numerous traces of them--must necessarily belong to those races of sure\r\n'b'foot and supple spine, chamois or goat. Several were seen, but this\r\n'b'was not the name Pencroft gave them, for all of a sudden--\xe2\x80\x9cSheep!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n'b'shouted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All stopped about fifty feet from half-a-dozen animals of a large size,\r\n'b'with strong horns bent back and flattened towards the point, with a\r\n'b'woolly fleece, hidden under long silky hair of a tawny color.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were not ordinary sheep, but a species usually found in the\r\n'b'mountainous regions of the temperate zone, to which Herbert gave the\r\n'b'name of the musmon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave they legs and chops?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, they are sheep!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The animals, motionless among the blocks of basalt, gazed with an\r\n'b'astonished eye, as if they saw human bipeds for the first time. Then\r\n'b'their fears suddenly aroused, they disappeared, bounding over the rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood-bye, till we meet again,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, as he watched them, in\r\n'b'such a comical tone that Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Neb\r\n'b'could not help laughing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The ascent was continued. Here and there were traces of lava. Sulphur\r\n'b'springs sometimes stopped their way, and they had to go round them. In\r\n'b'some places the sulphur had formed crystals among other substances, such\r\n'b'as whitish cinders made of an infinity of little feldspar crystals.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In approaching the first plateau formed by the truncating of the lower\r\n'b'cone, the difficulties of the ascent were very great. Towards four\r\n'b'o\xe2\x80\x99clock the extreme zone of the trees had been passed. There only\r\n'b'remained here and there a few twisted, stunted pines, which must have\r\n'b'had a hard life in resisting at this altitude the high winds from the\r\n'b'open sea. Happily for the engineer and his companions the weather was\r\n'b'beautiful, the atmosphere tranquil; for a high breeze at an elevation of\r\n'b'three thousand feet would have hindered their proceedings. The purity\r\n'b'of the sky at the zenith was felt through the transparent air. A perfect\r\n'b'calm reigned around them. They could not see the sun, then hid by the\r\n'b'vast screen of the upper cone, which masked the half-horizon of the\r\n'b'west, and whose enormous shadow stretching to the shore increased as\r\n'b'the radiant luminary sank in its diurnal course. Vapor--mist rather than\r\n'b'clouds--began to appear in the east, and assume all the prismatic colors\r\n'b'under the influence of the solar rays.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Five hundred feet only separated the explorers from the plateau, which\r\n'b'they wished to reach so as to establish there an encampment for the\r\n'b'night, but these five hundred feet were increased to more than two miles\r\n'b'by the zigzags which they had to describe. The soil, as it were, slid\r\n'b'under their feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The slope often presented such an angle that they slipped when the\r\n'b'stones worn by the air did not give a sufficient support. Evening\r\n'b'came on by degrees, and it was almost night when Cyrus Harding and his\r\n'b'companions, much fatigued by an ascent of seven hours, arrived at\r\n'b'the plateau of the first cone. It was then necessary to prepare an\r\n'b'encampment, and to restore their strength by eating first and sleeping\r\n'b'afterwards. This second stage of the mountain rose on a base of rocks,\r\n'b'among which it would be easy to find a retreat. Fuel was not abundant.\r\n'b'However, a fire could be made by means of the moss and dry brushwood,\r\n'b'which covered certain parts of the plateau. While the sailor was\r\n'b'preparing his hearth with stones which he put to this use, Neb and\r\n'b'Herbert occupied themselves with getting a supply of fuel. They soon\r\n'b'returned with a load of brushwood. The steel was struck, the burnt linen\r\n'b'caught the sparks of flint, and, under Neb\xe2\x80\x99s breath, a crackling fire\r\n'b'showed itself in a few minutes under the shelter of the rocks. Their\r\n'b'object in lighting a fire was only to enable them to withstand the cold\r\n'b'temperature of the night, as it was not employed in cooking the bird,\r\n'b'which Neb kept for the next day. The remains of the capybara and\r\n'b'some dozens of the stone-pine almonds formed their supper. It was not\r\n'b'half-past six when all was finished.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding then thought of exploring in the half-light the large\r\n'b'circular layer which supported the upper cone of the mountain. Before\r\n'b'taking any rest, he wished to know if it was possible to get round the\r\n'b'base of the cone in the case of its sides being too steep and its summit\r\n'b'being inaccessible. This question preoccupied him, for it was possible\r\n'b'that from the way the hat inclined, that is to say, towards the north,\r\n'b'the plateau was not practicable. Also, if the summit of the mountain\r\n'b'could not be reached on one side, and if, on the other, they could not\r\n'b'get round the base of the cone, it would be impossible to survey the\r\n'b'western part of the country, and their object in making the ascent would\r\n'b'in part be altogether unattained.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer, accordingly, regardless of fatigue, leaving Pencroft and\r\n'b'Neb to arrange the beds, and Gideon Spilett to note the incidents of the\r\n'b'day, began to follow the edge of the plateau, going towards the north.\r\n'b'Herbert accompanied him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night was beautiful and still, the darkness was not yet deep. Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding and the boy walked near each other, without speaking. In\r\n'b'some places the plateau opened before them, and they passed without\r\n'b'hindrance. In others, obstructed by rocks, there was only a narrow path,\r\n'b'in which two persons could not walk abreast. After a walk of twenty\r\n'b'minutes, Cyrus Harding and Herbert were obliged to stop. From this point\r\n'b'the slope of the two cones became one. No shoulder here separated the\r\n'b'two parts of the mountain. The slope, being inclined almost seventy\r\n'b'degrees, the path became impracticable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But if the engineer and the boy were obliged to give up thoughts of\r\n'b'following a circular direction, in return an opportunity was given for\r\n'b'ascending the cone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, before them opened a deep hollow. It was the rugged mouth\r\n'b'of the crater, by which the eruptive liquid matter had escaped at\r\n'b'the periods when the volcano was still in activity. Hardened lava and\r\n'b'crusted scoria formed a sort of natural staircase of large steps, which\r\n'b'would greatly facilitate the ascent to the summit of the mountain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding took all this in at a glance, and without hesitating, followed\r\n'b'by the lad, he entered the enormous chasm in the midst of an increasing\r\n'b'obscurity.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was still a height of a thousand feet to overcome. Would the\r\n'b'interior acclivities of the crater be practicable? It would soon be\r\n'b'seen. The persevering engineer resolved to continue his ascent until\r\n'b'he was stopped. Happily these acclivities wound up the interior of the\r\n'b'volcano and favored their ascent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the volcano itself, it could not be doubted that it was completely\r\n'b'extinct. No smoke escaped from its sides; not a flame could be seen in\r\n'b'the dark hollows; not a roar, not a mutter, no trembling even issued\r\n'b'from this black well, which perhaps reached far into the bowels of the\r\n'b'earth. The atmosphere inside the crater was filled with no sulphurous\r\n'b'vapor. It was more than the sleep of a volcano; it was its complete\r\n'b'extinction. Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s attempt would succeed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Little by little, Herbert and he climbing up the sides of the interior,\r\n'b'saw the crater widen above their heads. The radius of this circular\r\n'b'portion of the sky, framed by the edge of the cone, increased obviously.\r\n'b'At each step, as it were, that the explorers made, fresh stars entered\r\n'b'the field of their vision. The magnificent constellations of the\r\n'b'southern sky shone resplendently. At the zenith glittered the splendid\r\n'b'Antares in the Scorpion, and not far was Alpha Centauri, which is\r\n'b'believed to be the nearest star to the terrestrial globe. Then, as the\r\n'b'crater widened, appeared Fomalhaut of the Fish, the Southern Triangle,\r\n'b'and lastly, nearly at the Antarctic Pole, the glittering Southern Cross,\r\n'b'which replaces the Polar Star of the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was nearly eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock when Cyrus Harding and Herbert set foot on\r\n'b'the highest ridge of the mountain at the summit of the cone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was then perfectly dark, and their gaze could not extend over a\r\n'b'radius of two miles. Did the sea surround this unknown land, or was it\r\n'b'connected in the west with some continent of the Pacific? It could not\r\n'b'yet be made out. Towards the west, a cloudy belt, clearly visible at the\r\n'b'horizon, increased the gloom, and the eye could not discover if the sky\r\n'b'and water were blended together in the same circular line.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But at one point of the horizon a vague light suddenly appeared, which\r\n'b'descended slowly in proportion as the cloud mounted to the zenith.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the slender crescent moon, already almost disappearing; but its\r\n'b'light was sufficient to show clearly the horizontal line, then detached\r\n'b'from the cloud, and the engineer could see its reflection trembling for\r\n'b'an instant on a liquid surface. Cyrus Harding seized the lad\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and\r\n'b'in a grave voice,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn island!\xe2\x80\x9d said he, at the moment when the lunar crescent disappeared\r\n'b'beneath the waves.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 11\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Half an hour later Cyrus Harding and Herbert had returned to the\r\n'b'encampment. The engineer merely told his companions that the land upon\r\n'b'which fate had thrown them was an island, and that the next day they\r\n'b'would consult. Then each settled himself as well as he could to sleep,\r\n'b'and in that rocky hole, at a height of two thousand five hundred feet\r\n'b'above the level of the sea, through a peaceful night, the islanders\r\n'b'enjoyed profound repose.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 30th of March, after a hasty breakfast, which\r\n'b'consisted solely of the roasted tragopan, the engineer wished to climb\r\n'b'again to the summit of the volcano, so as more attentively to survey\r\n'b'the island upon which he and his companions were imprisoned for life\r\n'b'perhaps, should the island be situated at a great distance from any\r\n'b'land, or if it was out of the course of vessels which visited the\r\n'b'archipelagoes of the Pacific Ocean. This time his companions followed\r\n'b'him in the new exploration. They also wished to see the island, on the\r\n'b'productions of which they must depend for the supply of all their wants.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was about seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning when Cyrus Harding, Herbert,\r\n'b'Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Neb quitted the encampment. No one\r\n'b'appeared to be anxious about their situation. They had faith in\r\n'b'themselves, doubtless, but it must be observed that the basis of this\r\n'b'faith was not the same with Harding as with his companions. The engineer\r\n'b'had confidence, because he felt capable of extorting from this wild\r\n'b'country everything necessary for the life of himself and his companions;\r\n'b'the latter feared nothing, just because Cyrus Harding was with them.\r\n'b'Pencroft especially, since the incident of the relighted fire, would\r\n'b'not have despaired for an instant, even if he was on a bare rock, if the\r\n'b'engineer was with him on the rock.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPshaw,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe left Richmond without permission from the\r\n'b'authorities! It will be hard if we don\xe2\x80\x99t manage to get away some day or\r\n'b'other from a place where certainly no one will detain us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding followed the same road as the evening before. They went\r\n'b'round the cone by the plateau which formed the shoulder, to the mouth of\r\n'b'the enormous chasm. The weather was magnificent. The sun rose in a pure\r\n'b'sky and flooded with his rays all the eastern side of the mountain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The crater was reached. It was just what the engineer had made it out to\r\n'b'be in the dark; that is to say, a vast funnel which extended, widening,\r\n'b'to a height of a thousand feet above the plateau. Below the chasm, large\r\n'b'thick streaks of lava wound over the sides of the mountain, and thus\r\n'b'marked the course of the eruptive matter to the lower valleys which\r\n'b'furrowed the northern part of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The interior of the crater, whose inclination did not exceed thirty five\r\n'b'to forty degrees, presented no difficulties nor obstacles to the ascent.\r\n'b'Traces of very ancient lava were noticed, which probably had overflowed\r\n'b'the summit of the cone, before this lateral chasm had opened a new way\r\n'b'to it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the volcanic chimney which established a communication between the\r\n'b'subterranean layers and the crater, its depth could not be calculated\r\n'b'with the eye, for it was lost in obscurity. But there was no doubt as to\r\n'b'the complete extinction of the volcano.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Before eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock Harding and his companions were assembled at the\r\n'b'summit of the crater, on a conical mound which swelled the northern\r\n'b'edge.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe sea, the sea everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d they cried, as if their lips could not\r\n'b'restrain the words which made islanders of them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sea, indeed, formed an immense circular sheet of water all around\r\n'b'them! Perhaps, on climbing again to the summit of the cone, Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding had had a hope of discovering some coast, some island shore,\r\n'b'which he had not been able to perceive in the dark the evening before.\r\n'b'But nothing appeared on the farthest verge of the horizon, that is to\r\n'b'say over a radius of more than fifty miles. No land in sight. Not a\r\n'b'sail. Over all this immense space the ocean alone was visible--the\r\n'b'island occupied the center of a circumference which appeared to be\r\n'b'infinite.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer and his companions, mute and motionless, surveyed for\r\n'b'some minutes every point of the ocean, examining it to its most extreme\r\n'b'limits. Even Pencroft, who possessed a marvelous power of sight, saw\r\n'b'nothing; and certainly if there had been land at the horizon, if it\r\n'b'appeared only as an indistinct vapor, the sailor would undoubtedly\r\n'b'have found it out, for nature had placed regular telescopes under his\r\n'b'eyebrows.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From the ocean their gaze returned to the island which they commanded\r\n'b'entirely, and the first question was put by Gideon Spilett in these\r\n'b'terms:\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout what size is this island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Truly, it did not appear large in the midst of the immense ocean.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding reflected a few minutes; he attentively observed the\r\n'b'perimeter of the island, taking into consideration the height at which\r\n'b'he was placed; then,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not think I am mistaken in giving to the\r\n'b'shore of the island a circumference of more than a hundred miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd consequently an area?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is difficult to estimate,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is so\r\n'b'uneven.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'If Cyrus Harding was not mistaken in his calculation, the island had\r\n'b'almost the extent of Malta or Zante, in the Mediterranean, but it was at\r\n'b'the same time much more irregular and less rich in capes, promontories,\r\n'b'points, bays, or creeks. Its strange form caught the eye, and when\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett, on the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s advice, had drawn the outline, they\r\n'b'found that it resembled some fantastic animal, a monstrous leviathan,\r\n'b'which lay sleeping on the surface of the Pacific.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was in fact the exact shape of the island, which it is of\r\n'b'consequence to know, and a tolerably correct map of it was immediately\r\n'b'drawn by the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The east part of the shore, where the castaways had landed, formed a\r\n'b'wide bay, terminated by a sharp cape, which had been concealed by a high\r\n'b'point from Pencroft on his first exploration. At the northeast two other\r\n'b'capes closed the bay, and between them ran a narrow gulf, which looked\r\n'b'like the half-open jaws of a formidable dog-fish.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From the northeast to the southwest the coast was rounded, like\r\n'b'the flattened cranium of an animal, rising again, forming a sort of\r\n'b'protuberance which did not give any particular shape to this part of the\r\n'b'island, of which the center was occupied by the volcano.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From this point the shore ran pretty regularly north and south, broken\r\n'b'at two-thirds of its perimeter by a narrow creek, from which it ended in\r\n'b'a long tail, similar to the caudal appendage of a gigantic alligator.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This tail formed a regular peninsula, which stretched more than thirty\r\n'b'miles into the sea, reckoning from the cape southeast of the island,\r\n'b'already mentioned; it curled round, making an open roadstead, which\r\n'b'marked out the lower shore of this strangely-formed land.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At the narrowest part, that is to say between the Chimneys and the creek\r\n'b'on the western shore, which corresponded to it in latitude, the island\r\n'b'only measured ten miles; but its greatest length, from the jaws at the\r\n'b'northeast to the extremity of the tail of the southwest, was not less\r\n'b'than thirty miles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the interior of the island, its general aspect was this, very\r\n'b'woody throughout the southern part from the mountain to the shore, and\r\n'b'arid and sandy in the northern part. Between the volcano and the east\r\n'b'coast Cyrus Harding and his companions were surprised to see a\r\n'b'lake, bordered with green trees, the existence of which they had not\r\n'b'suspected. Seen from this height, the lake appeared to be on the same\r\n'b'level as the ocean, but, on reflection, the engineer explained to his\r\n'b'companions that the altitude of this little sheet of water must be about\r\n'b'three hundred feet, because the plateau, which was its basin, was but a\r\n'b'prolongation of the coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs it a freshwater lake?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it must be fed by the water\r\n'b'which flows from the mountain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI see a little river which runs into it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, pointing out a\r\n'b'narrow stream, which evidently took its source somewhere in the west.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cand since this stream feeds the lake, most\r\n'b'probably on the side near the sea there is an outlet by which the\r\n'b'surplus water escapes. We shall see that on our return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This little winding watercourse and the river already mentioned\r\n'b'constituted the water-system, at least such as it was displayed to the\r\n'b'eyes of the explorers. However, it was possible that under the masses of\r\n'b'trees which covered two-thirds of the island, forming an immense forest,\r\n'b'other rivers ran towards the sea. It might even be inferred that such\r\n'b'was the case, so rich did this region appear in the most magnificent\r\n'b'specimens of the flora of the temperate zones. There was no indication\r\n'b'of running water in the north, though perhaps there might be stagnant\r\n'b'water among the marshes in the northeast; but that was all, in addition\r\n'b'to the downs, sand, and aridity which contrasted so strongly with the\r\n'b'luxuriant vegetation of the rest of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The volcano did not occupy the central part; it rose, on the contrary,\r\n'b'in the northwestern region, and seemed to mark the boundary of the two\r\n'b'zones. At the southwest, at the south, and the southeast, the first part\r\n'b'of the spurs were hidden under masses of verdure. At the north, on the\r\n'b'contrary, one could follow their ramifications, which died away on the\r\n'b'sandy plains. It was on this side that, at the time when the mountain\r\n'b'was in a state of eruption, the discharge had worn away a passage, and\r\n'b'a large heap of lava had spread to the narrow jaw which formed the\r\n'b'northeastern gulf.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions remained an hour at the top of the\r\n'b'mountain. The island was displayed under their eyes, like a plan in\r\n'b'relief with different tints, green for the forests, yellow for the\r\n'b'sand, blue for the water. They viewed it in its tout-ensemble, nothing\r\n'b'remained concealed but the ground hidden by verdure, the hollows of the\r\n'b'valleys, and the interior of the volcanic chasms.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'One important question remained to be solved, and the answer would have\r\n'b'a great effect upon the future of the castaways.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Was the island inhabited?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the reporter who put this question, to which after the close\r\n'b'examination they had just made, the answer seemed to be in the negative.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nowhere could the work of a human hand be perceived. Not a group of\r\n'b'huts, not a solitary cabin, not a fishery on the shore. No smoke curling\r\n'b'in the air betrayed the presence of man. It is true, a distance of\r\n'b'nearly thirty miles separated the observers from the extreme points,\r\n'b'that is, of the tail which extended to the southwest, and it would have\r\n'b'been difficult, even to Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s eyes, to discover a habitation there.\r\n'b'Neither could the curtain of verdure, which covered three-quarters\r\n'b'of the island, be raised to see if it did not shelter some straggling\r\n'b'village. But in general the islanders live on the shores of the narrow\r\n'b'spaces which emerge above the waters of the Pacific, and this shore\r\n'b'appeared to be an absolute desert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Until a more complete exploration, it might be admitted that the island\r\n'b'was uninhabited. But was it frequented, at least occasionally, by\r\n'b'the natives of neighboring islands? It was difficult to reply to this\r\n'b'question. No land appeared within a radius of fifty miles. But fifty\r\n'b'miles could be easily crossed, either by Malay proas or by the large\r\n'b'Polynesian canoes. Everything depended on the position of the island,\r\n'b'of its isolation in the Pacific, or of its proximity to archipelagoes.\r\n'b'Would Cyrus Harding be able to find out their latitude and longitude\r\n'b'without instruments? It would be difficult. Since he was in doubt, it\r\n'b'was best to take precautions against a possible descent of neighboring\r\n'b'natives.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The exploration of the island was finished, its shape determined, its\r\n'b'features made out, its extent calculated, the water and mountain systems\r\n'b'ascertained. The disposition of the forests and plains had been marked\r\n'b'in a general way on the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s plan. They had now only to descend\r\n'b'the mountain slopes again, and explore the soil, in the triple point of\r\n'b'view, of its mineral, vegetable, and animal resources.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But before giving his companions the signal for departure, Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'said to them in a calm, grave voice,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere, my friends, is the small corner of land upon which the hand of\r\n'b'the Almighty has thrown us. We are going to live here; a long time,\r\n'b'perhaps. Perhaps, too, unexpected help will arrive, if some ship passes\r\n'b'by chance. I say by chance, because this is an unimportant island; there\r\n'b'is not even a port in which ships could anchor, and it is to be feared\r\n'b'that it is situated out of the route usually followed, that is to say,\r\n'b'too much to the south for the ships which frequent the archipelagoes of\r\n'b'the Pacific, and too much to the north for those which go to Australia\r\n'b'by doubling Cape Horn. I wish to hide nothing of our position from\r\n'b'you--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are right, my dear Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, with\r\n'b'animation. \xe2\x80\x9cYou have to deal with men. They have confidence in you, and\r\n'b'you can depend upon them. Is it not so, my friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will obey you in everything, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, seizing the\r\n'b'engineer\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy master always, and everywhere!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs for me,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cif I ever grumble at work, my name\xe2\x80\x99s not\r\n'b'Jack Pencroft, and if you like, captain, we will make a little America\r\n'b'of this island! We will build towns, we will establish railways, start\r\n'b'telegraphs, and one fine day, when it is quite changed, quite put in\r\n'b'order and quite civilized, we will go and offer it to the government of\r\n'b'the Union. Only, I ask one thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, that we do not consider ourselves castaways, but colonists,\r\n'b'who have come here to settle.\xe2\x80\x9d Harding could not help smiling, and the\r\n'b'sailor\xe2\x80\x99s idea was adopted. He then thanked his companions, and added,\r\n'b'that he would rely on their energy and on the aid of Heaven.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, now let us set off to the Chimneys!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne minute, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me it would\r\n'b'be a good thing to give a name to this island, as well as to, the capes,\r\n'b'promontories, and watercourses, which we can see.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cIn the future, that will simplify the\r\n'b'instructions which we shall have to give and follow.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9calready it is something to be able to say\r\n'b'where one is going, and where one has come from. At least, it looks like\r\n'b'somewhere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Chimneys, for example,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cExactly!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cThat name was the most convenient, and it\r\n'b'came to me quite of myself. Shall we keep the name of the Chimneys for\r\n'b'our first encampment, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pencroft, since you have so christened it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood! as for the others, that will be easy,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor, who\r\n'b'was in high spirits. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us give them names, as the Robinsons did,\r\n'b'whose story Herbert has often read to me; Providence Bay, Whale Point,\r\n'b'Cape Disappointment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOr, rather, the names of Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cof Mr.\r\n'b'Spilett, of Neb!--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy name!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb, showing his sparkling white teeth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cPort Neb, that would do very well! And\r\n'b'Cape Gideon--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI should prefer borrowing names from our country,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cwhich would remind us of America.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, for the principal ones,\xe2\x80\x9d then said Cyrus Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cfor those of\r\n'b'the bays and seas, I admit it willingly. We might give to that vast bay\r\n'b'on the east the name of Union Bay, for example; to that large hollow on\r\n'b'the south, Washington Bay; to the mountain upon which we are standing,\r\n'b'that of Mount Franklin; to that lake which is extended under our eyes,\r\n'b'that of Lake Grant; nothing could be better, my friends. These names\r\n'b'will recall our country, and those of the great citizens who have\r\n'b'honored it; but for the rivers, gulfs, capes, and promontories, which we\r\n'b'perceive from the top of this mountain, rather let us choose names which\r\n'b'will recall their particular shape. They will impress themselves better\r\n'b'on our memory, and at the same time will be more practical. The shape of\r\n'b'the island is so strange that we shall not be troubled to imagine\r\n'b'what it resembles. As to the streams which we do not know as yet, in\r\n'b'different parts of the forest which we shall explore later, the creeks\r\n'b'which afterwards will be discovered, we can christen them as we find\r\n'b'them. What do you think, my friends?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was unanimously agreed to by his companions. The\r\n'b'island was spread out under their eyes like a map, and they had only to\r\n'b'give names to all its angles and points. Gideon Spilett would write\r\n'b'them down, and the geographical nomenclature of the island would be\r\n'b'definitely adopted. First, they named the two bays and the mountain,\r\n'b'Union Bay, Washington Bay, and Mount Franklin, as the engineer had\r\n'b'suggested.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cto this peninsula at the southwest of the\r\n'b'island, I propose to give the name of Serpentine Peninsula, and that of\r\n'b'Reptile-end to the bent tail which terminates it, for it is just like a\r\n'b'reptile\xe2\x80\x99s tail.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAdopted,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, pointing to the other extremity of the island, \xe2\x80\x9clet\r\n'b'us call this gulf which is so singularly like a pair of open jaws, Shark\r\n'b'Gulf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand we can complete the resemblance by\r\n'b'naming the two parts of the jaws Mandible Cape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut there are two capes,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can have North Mandible Cape and South\r\n'b'Mandible Cape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are inscribed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is only the point at the southeastern extremity of the island to\r\n'b'be named,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, the extremity of Union Bay?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cClaw Cape,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb directly, who also wished to be godfather to some\r\n'b'part of his domain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In truth, Neb had found an excellent name, for this cape was very like\r\n'b'the powerful claw of the fantastic animal which this singularly-shaped\r\n'b'island represented.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft was delighted at the turn things had taken, and their\r\n'b'imaginations soon gave to the river which furnished the settlers with\r\n'b'drinking water and near which the balloon had thrown them, the name of\r\n'b'the Mercy, in true gratitude to Providence. To the islet upon which the\r\n'b'castaways had first landed, the name of Safety Island; to the plateau\r\n'b'which crowned the high granite precipice above the Chimneys, and from\r\n'b'whence the gaze could embrace the whole of the vast bay, the name of\r\n'b'Prospect Heights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Lastly, all the masses of impenetrable wood which covered the Serpentine\r\n'b'Peninsula were named the forests of the Far West.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The nomenclature of the visible and known parts of the island was\r\n'b'thus finished, and later, they would complete it as they made fresh\r\n'b'discoveries.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the points of the compass, the engineer had roughly fixed them by\r\n'b'the height and position of the sun, which placed Union Bay and Prospect\r\n'b'Heights to the east. But the next day, by taking the exact hour of the\r\n'b'rising and setting of the sun, and by marking its position between this\r\n'b'rising and setting, he reckoned to fix the north of the island exactly,\r\n'b'for, in consequence of its situation in the Southern Hemisphere, the\r\n'b'sun, at the precise moment of its culmination, passed in the north and\r\n'b'not in the south, as, in its apparent movement, it seems to do, to those\r\n'b'places situated in the Northern Hemisphere.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Everything was finished, and the settlers had only to descend Mount\r\n'b'Franklin to return to the Chimneys, when Pencroft cried out,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell! we are preciously stupid!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett, who had closed his notebook and risen to\r\n'b'depart.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! our island! we have forgotten to christen it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert was going to propose to give it the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s name and all his\r\n'b'companions would have applauded him, when Cyrus Harding said simply,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us give it the name of a great citizen, my friend; of him who now\r\n'b'struggles to defend the unity of the American Republic! Let us call it\r\n'b'Lincoln Island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s proposal was replied to by three hurrahs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And that evening, before sleeping, the new colonists talked of their\r\n'b'absent country; they spoke of the terrible war which stained it with\r\n'b'blood; they could not doubt that the South would soon be subdued, and\r\n'b'that the cause of the North, the cause of justice, would triumph, thanks\r\n'b'to Grant, thanks to Lincoln!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now this happened the 30th of March, 1865. They little knew that sixteen\r\n'b'days afterwards a frightful crime would be committed in Washington, and\r\n'b'that on Good Friday Abraham Lincoln would fall by the hand of a fanatic.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 12\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They now began the descent of the mountain. Climbing down the crater,\r\n'b'they went round the cone and reached their encampment of the previous\r\n'b'night. Pencroft thought it must be breakfast-time, and the watches of\r\n'b'the reporter and engineer were therefore consulted to find out the hour.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That of Gideon Spilett had been preserved from the sea-water, as he had\r\n'b'been thrown at once on the sand out of reach of the waves. It was an\r\n'b'instrument of excellent quality, a perfect pocket chronometer, which the\r\n'b'reporter had not forgotten to wind up carefully every day.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s watch, it, of course, had stopped during the time\r\n'b'which he had passed on the downs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer now wound it up, and ascertaining by the height of the sun\r\n'b'that it must be about nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, he put his watch at\r\n'b'that hour.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear Spilett, wait. You have kept the Richmond time, have you\r\n'b'not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Cyrus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cConsequently, your watch is set by the meridian of that town, which is\r\n'b'almost that of Washington?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUndoubtedly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, keep it thus. Content yourself with winding it up very,\r\n'b'exactly, but do not touch the hands. This may be of use to us.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will be the good of that?\xe2\x80\x9d thought the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They ate, and so heartily, that the store of game and almonds was\r\n'b'totally exhausted. But Pencroft was not at all uneasy, they would supply\r\n'b'themselves on the way. Top, whose share had been very much to his taste,\r\n'b'would know how to find some fresh game among the brushwood. Moreover,\r\n'b'the sailor thought of simply asking the engineer to manufacture some\r\n'b'powder and one or two fowling-pieces; he supposed there would be no\r\n'b'difficulty in that.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On leaving the plateau, the captain proposed to his companions to return\r\n'b'to the Chimneys by a new way. He wished to reconnoiter Lake Grant, so\r\n'b'magnificently framed in trees. They therefore followed the crest of one\r\n'b'of the spurs, between which the creek that supplied the lake probably\r\n'b'had its source. In talking, the settlers already employed the names\r\n'b'which they had just chosen, which singularly facilitated the exchange\r\n'b'of their ideas. Herbert and Pencroft--the one young and the other very\r\n'b'boyish--were enchanted, and while walking, the sailor said,\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHey, Herbert! how capital it sounds! It will be impossible to lose\r\n'b'ourselves, my boy, since, whether we follow the way to Lake Grant, or\r\n'b'whether we join the Mercy through the woods of the Far West, we shall be\r\n'b'certain to arrive at Prospect Heights, and, consequently, at Union Bay!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It had been agreed, that without forming a compact band, the settlers\r\n'b'should not stray away from each other. It was very certain that the\r\n'b'thick forests of the island were inhabited by dangerous animals, and it\r\n'b'was prudent to be on their guard. In general, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb\r\n'b'walked first, preceded by Top, who poked his nose into every bush. The\r\n'b'reporter and the engineer went together, Gideon Spilett ready to note\r\n'b'every incident, the engineer silent for the most part, and only stepping\r\n'b'aside to pick up one thing or another, a mineral or vegetable substance,\r\n'b'which he put into his pocket, without making any remark.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can he be picking up?\xe2\x80\x9d muttered Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cI have looked in vain\r\n'b'for anything that\xe2\x80\x99s worth the trouble of stooping for.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock the little band descended the last declivities of\r\n'b'Mount Franklin. As yet the ground was scantily strewn with bushes and\r\n'b'trees. They were walking over yellowish calcinated earth, forming a\r\n'b'plain of nearly a mile long, which extended to the edge of the wood.\r\n'b'Great blocks of that basalt, which, according to Bischof, takes three\r\n'b'hundred and fifty millions of years to cool, strewed the plain, very\r\n'b'confused in some places. However, there were here no traces of lava,\r\n'b'which was spread more particularly over the northern slopes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding expected to reach, without incident, the course of the\r\n'b'creek, which he supposed flowed under the trees at the border of the\r\n'b'plain, when he saw Herbert running hastily back, while Neb and the\r\n'b'sailor were hiding behind the rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSmoke,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have seen smoke among the rocks, a hundred\r\n'b'paces from us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMen in this place?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must avoid showing ourselves before knowing with whom we have to\r\n'b'deal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cI trust that there are no natives on this\r\n'b'island; I dread them more than anything else. Where is Top?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop is on before.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is strange. However, we must try to call him back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few moments, the engineer, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert had rejoined\r\n'b'their two companions, and like them, they kept out of sight behind the\r\n'b'heaps of basalt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From thence they clearly saw smoke of a yellowish color rising in the\r\n'b'air.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top was recalled by a slight whistle from his master, and the latter,\r\n'b'signing to his companions to wait for him, glided away among the\r\n'b'rocks. The colonists, motionless, anxiously awaited the result of this\r\n'b'exploration, when a shout from the engineer made them hasten forward.\r\n'b'They soon joined him, and were at once struck with a disagreeable odor\r\n'b'which impregnated the atmosphere.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The odor, easily recognized, was enough for the engineer to guess what\r\n'b'the smoke was which at first, not without cause, had startled him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis fire,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cor rather, this smoke is produced by nature alone.\r\n'b'There is a sulphur spring there, which will cure all our sore throats.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity that I haven\xe2\x80\x99t got a cold!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers then directed their steps towards the place from which the\r\n'b'smoke escaped. They there saw a sulphur spring which flowed abundantly\r\n'b'between the rocks, and its waters discharged a strong sulphuric acid\r\n'b'odor, after having absorbed the oxygen of the air.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, dipping in his hand, felt the water oily to the touch.\r\n'b'He tasted it and found it rather sweet. As to its temperature, that he\r\n'b'estimated at ninety-five degrees Fahrenheit. Herbert having asked on\r\n'b'what he based this calculation,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIts quite simple, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cfor, in plunging my hand into the\r\n'b'water, I felt no sensation either of heat or cold. Therefore it has the\r\n'b'same temperature as the human body, which is about ninety-five degrees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sulphur spring not being of any actual use to the settlers, they\r\n'b'proceeded towards the thick border of the forest, which began some\r\n'b'hundred paces off.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There, as they had conjectured, the waters of the stream flowed clear\r\n'b'and limpid between high banks of red earth, the color of which betrayed\r\n'b'the presence of oxide of iron. From this color, the name of Red Creek\r\n'b'was immediately given to the watercourse.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was only a large stream, deep and clear, formed of the mountain\r\n'b'water, which, half river, half torrent, here rippling peacefully over\r\n'b'the sand, there falling against the rocks or dashing down in a cascade,\r\n'b'ran towards the lake, over a distance of a mile and a half, its breadth\r\n'b'varying from thirty to forty feet. Its waters were sweet, and it was\r\n'b'supposed that those of the lake were so also. A fortunate circumstance,\r\n'b'in the event of their finding on its borders a more suitable dwelling\r\n'b'than the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the trees, which some hundred feet downwards shaded the banks of\r\n'b'the creek, they belonged, for the most part, to the species which abound\r\n'b'in the temperate zone of America and Tasmania, and no longer to those\r\n'b'coniferae observed in that portion of the island already explored\r\n'b'to some miles from Prospect Heights. At this time of the year, the\r\n'b'commencement of the month of April, which represents the month of\r\n'b'October, in this hemisphere, that is, the beginning of autumn, they\r\n'b'were still in full leaf. They consisted principally of casuarinas and\r\n'b'eucalypti, some of which next year would yield a sweet manna, similar to\r\n'b'the manna of the East. Clumps of Australian cedars rose on the sloping\r\n'b'banks, which were also covered with the high grass called \xe2\x80\x9ctussac\xe2\x80\x9d in\r\n'b'New Holland; but the cocoanut, so abundant in the archipelagoes of the\r\n'b'Pacific, seemed to be wanting in the island, the latitude, doubtless,\r\n'b'being too low.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a pity!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9csuch a useful tree, and which has such\r\n'b'beautiful nuts!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the birds, they swarmed among the scanty branches of the eucalypti\r\n'b'and casuarinas, which did not hinder the display of their wings.\r\n'b'Black, white, or gray cockatoos, paroquets, with plumage of all colors,\r\n'b'kingfishers of a sparkling green and crowned with red, blue lories,\r\n'b'and various other birds appeared on all sides, as through a prism,\r\n'b'fluttering about and producing a deafening clamor. Suddenly, a strange\r\n'b'concert of discordant voices resounded in the midst of a thicket. The\r\n'b'settlers heard successively the song of birds, the cry of quadrupeds,\r\n'b'and a sort of clacking which they might have believed to have escaped\r\n'b'from the lips of a native. Neb and Herbert rushed towards the bush,\r\n'b'forgetting even the most elementary principles of prudence. Happily,\r\n'b'they found there, neither a formidable wild beast nor a dangerous\r\n'b'native, but merely half a dozen mocking and singing birds, known as\r\n'b'mountain pheasants. A few skillful blows from a stick soon put an end to\r\n'b'their concert, and procured excellent food for the evening\xe2\x80\x99s dinner.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert also discovered some magnificent pigeons with bronzed wings,\r\n'b'some superbly crested, others draped in green, like their congeners at\r\n'b'Port-Macquarie; but it was impossible to reach them, or the crows and\r\n'b'magpies which flew away in flocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A charge of small shot would have made great slaughter among these\r\n'b'birds, but the hunters were still limited to sticks and stones, and\r\n'b'these primitive weapons proved very insufficient.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their insufficiency was still more clearly shown when a troop of\r\n'b'quadrupeds, jumping, bounding, making leaps of thirty feet, regular\r\n'b'flying mammiferae, fled over the thickets, so quickly and at such a\r\n'b'height, that one would have thought that they passed from one tree to\r\n'b'another like squirrels.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cKangaroos!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre they good to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStewed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9ctheir flesh is equal to the best\r\n'b'venison!--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett had not finished this exciting sentence when the sailor,\r\n'b'followed by Neb and Herbert, darted on the kangaroos tracks. Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding called them back in vain. But it was in vain too for the hunters\r\n'b'to pursue such agile game, which went bounding away like balls. After a\r\n'b'chase of five minutes, they lost their breath, and at the same time all\r\n'b'sight of the creatures, which disappeared in the wood. Top was not more\r\n'b'successful than his masters.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, when the engineer and the reporter had\r\n'b'rejoined them, \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, you see quite well we can\xe2\x80\x99t get on unless we\r\n'b'make a few guns. Will that be possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we will begin by first\r\n'b'manufacturing some bows and arrows, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t doubt that you will\r\n'b'become as clever in the use of them as the Australian hunters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBows and arrows!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft scornfully. \xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very well for\r\n'b'children!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t be proud, friend Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cBows and\r\n'b'arrows were sufficient for centuries to stain the earth with blood.\r\n'b'Powder is but a thing of yesterday, and war is as old as the human\r\n'b'race--unhappily.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFaith, that\xe2\x80\x99s true, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand I always\r\n'b'speak too quickly. You must excuse me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, Herbert constant to his favorite science, Natural History,\r\n'b'reverted to the kangaroos, saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, we had to deal just now with the species which is most\r\n'b'difficult to catch. They were giants with long gray fur; but if I am not\r\n'b'mistaken, there exist black and red kangaroos, rock kangaroos, and rat\r\n'b'kangaroos, which are more easy to get hold of. It is reckoned that there\r\n'b'are about a dozen species.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor sententiously, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is only one species\r\n'b'of kangaroos to me, that is \xe2\x80\x98kangaroo on the spit,\xe2\x80\x99 and it\xe2\x80\x99s just the\r\n'b'one we haven\xe2\x80\x99t got this evening!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They could not help laughing at Master Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s new classification.\r\n'b'The honest sailor did not hide his regret at being reduced for dinner to\r\n'b'the singing pheasants, but fortune once more showed itself obliging to\r\n'b'him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, Top, who felt that his interest was concerned went and ferreted\r\n'b'everywhere with an instinct doubled by a ferocious appetite. It was even\r\n'b'probable that if some piece of game did fall into his clutches, none\r\n'b'would be left for the hunters, if Top was hunting on his own account;\r\n'b'but Neb watched him and he did well.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards three o\xe2\x80\x99clock the dog disappeared in the brushwood and gruntings\r\n'b'showed that he was engaged in a struggle with some animal. Neb rushed\r\n'b'after him, and soon saw Top eagerly devouring a quadruped, which ten\r\n'b'seconds later would have been past recognizing in Top\xe2\x80\x99s stomach. But\r\n'b'fortunately the dog had fallen upon a brood, and besides the victim he\r\n'b'was devouring, two other rodents--the animals in question belonged to\r\n'b'that order--lay strangled on the turf.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb reappeared triumphantly holding one of the rodents in each hand.\r\n'b'Their size exceeded that of a rabbit, their hair was yellow, mingled\r\n'b'with green spots, and they had the merest rudiments of tails.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The citizens of the Union were at no loss for the right name of these\r\n'b'rodents. They were maras, a sort of agouti, a little larger than their\r\n'b'congeners of tropical countries, regular American rabbits, with long\r\n'b'ears, jaws armed on each side with five molars, which distinguish the\r\n'b'agouti.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthe roast has arrived! and now we can go\r\n'b'home.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The walk, interrupted for an instant, was resumed. The limpid waters of\r\n'b'the Red Creek flowed under an arch of casuarinas, banksias, and gigantic\r\n'b'gum-trees. Superb lilacs rose to a height of twenty feet. Other\r\n'b'arborescent species, unknown to the young naturalist, bent over the\r\n'b'stream, which could be heard murmuring beneath the bowers of verdure.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile the stream grew much wider, and Cyrus Harding supposed that\r\n'b'they would soon reach its mouth. In fact, on emerging from beneath a\r\n'b'thick clump of beautiful trees, it suddenly appeared before their eyes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The explorers had arrived on the western shore of Lake Grant. The place\r\n'b'was well worth looking at. This extent of water, of a circumference of\r\n'b'nearly seven miles and an area of two hundred and fifty acres, reposed\r\n'b'in a border of diversified trees. Towards the east, through a curtain\r\n'b'of verdure, picturesquely raised in some places, sparkled an horizon of\r\n'b'sea. The lake was curved at the north, which contrasted with the sharp\r\n'b'outline of its lower part. Numerous aquatic birds frequented the shores\r\n'b'of this little Ontario, in which the thousand isles of its American\r\n'b'namesake were represented by a rock which emerged from its surface, some\r\n'b'hundred feet from the southern shore. There lived in harmony several\r\n'b'couples of kingfishers perched on a stone, grave, motionless, watching\r\n'b'for fish, then darting down, they plunged in with a sharp cry, and\r\n'b'reappeared with their prey in their beaks. On the shores and on the\r\n'b'islets, strutted wild ducks, pelicans, water-hens, red-beaks, philedons,\r\n'b'furnished with a tongue like a brush, and one or two specimens of the\r\n'b'splendid menura, the tail of which expands gracefully like a lyre.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the water of the lake, it was sweet, limpid, rather dark, and from\r\n'b'certain bubblings, and the concentric circles which crossed each other\r\n'b'on the surface, it could not be doubted that it abounded in fish.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis lake is really beautiful!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cWe could live on\r\n'b'its borders!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will live there!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers, wishing to return to the Chimneys by the shortest way,\r\n'b'descended towards the angle formed on the south by the junction of\r\n'b'the lake\xe2\x80\x99s bank. It was not without difficulty that they broke a path\r\n'b'through the thickets and brushwood which had never been put aside by the\r\n'b'hand of men, and they thus went towards the shore, so as to arrive at\r\n'b'the north of Prospect Heights. Two miles were cleared in this direction,\r\n'b'and then, after they had passed the last curtain of trees, appeared the\r\n'b'plateau, carpeted with thick turf, and beyond that the infinite sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To return to the Chimneys, it was enough to cross the plateau obliquely\r\n'b'for the space of a mile, and then to descend to the elbow formed by\r\n'b'the first detour of the Mercy. But the engineer desired to know how\r\n'b'and where the overplus of the water from the lake escaped, and the\r\n'b'exploration was prolonged under the trees for a mile and a half towards\r\n'b'the north. It was most probable that an overfall existed somewhere, and\r\n'b'doubtless through a cleft in the granite. This lake was only, in short,\r\n'b'an immense center basin, which was filled by degrees by the creek, and\r\n'b'its waters must necessarily pass to the sea by some fall. If it was so,\r\n'b'the engineer thought that it might perhaps be possible to utilize this\r\n'b'fall and borrow its power, actually lost without profit to any one.\r\n'b'They continued then to follow the shores of Lake Grant by climbing the\r\n'b'plateau; but, after having gone a mile in this direction, Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'had not been able to discover the overfall, which, however, must exist\r\n'b'somewhere.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was then half-past four. In order to prepare for dinner it was\r\n'b'necessary that the settlers should return to their dwelling. The little\r\n'b'band retraced their steps, therefore, and by the left bank of the Mercy,\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions arrived at the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The fire was lighted, and Neb and Pencroft, on whom the functions of\r\n'b'cooks naturally devolved, to the one in his quality of Negro, to the\r\n'b'other in that of sailor, quickly prepared some broiled agouti, to which\r\n'b'they did great justice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The repast at length terminated; at the moment when each one was about\r\n'b'to give himself up to sleep, Cyrus Harding drew from his pocket little\r\n'b'specimens of different sorts of minerals, and just said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends, this is iron mineral, this a pyrite, this is clay, this is\r\n'b'lime, and this is coal. Nature gives us these things. It is our business\r\n'b'to make a right use of them. To-morrow we will commence operations.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 13\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, captain, where are we going to begin?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft next\r\n'b'morning of the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And in fact, the settlers were compelled to begin \xe2\x80\x9cat the very\r\n'b'beginning.\xe2\x80\x9d They did not possess even the tools necessary for making\r\n'b'tools, and they were not even in the condition of nature, who, \xe2\x80\x9chaving\r\n'b'time, husbands her strength.\xe2\x80\x9d They had no time, since they had to\r\n'b'provide for the immediate wants of their existence, and though,\r\n'b'profiting by acquired experience, they had nothing to invent, still they\r\n'b'had everything to make; their iron and their steel were as yet only in\r\n'b'the state of minerals, their earthenware in the state of clay, their\r\n'b'linen and their clothes in the state of textile material.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It must be said, however, that the settlers were \xe2\x80\x9cmen\xe2\x80\x9d in the complete\r\n'b'and higher sense of the word. The engineer Harding could not have been\r\n'b'seconded by more intelligent companions, nor with more devotion and\r\n'b'zeal. He had tried them. He knew their abilities.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett, a talented reporter, having learned everything so as to\r\n'b'be able to speak of everything, would contribute largely with his head\r\n'b'and hands to the colonization of the island. He would not draw back from\r\n'b'any task: a determined sportsman, he would make a business of what till\r\n'b'then had only been a pleasure to him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert, a gallant boy, already remarkably well informed in the natural\r\n'b'sciences, would render greater service to the common cause.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb was devotion personified. Clever, intelligent, indefatigable,\r\n'b'robust, with iron health, he knew a little about the work of the forge,\r\n'b'and could not fail to be very useful in the colony.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to Pencroft, he had sailed over every sea, a carpenter in the\r\n'b'dockyards in Brooklyn, assistant tailor in the vessels of the state,\r\n'b'gardener, cultivator, during his holidays, etc., and like all seamen,\r\n'b'fit for anything, he knew how to do everything.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It would have been difficult to unite five men, better fitted to\r\n'b'struggle against fate, more certain to triumph over it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt the beginning,\xe2\x80\x9d Cyrus Harding had said. Now this beginning of which\r\n'b'the engineer spoke was the construction of an apparatus which would\r\n'b'serve to transform the natural substances. The part which heat plays in\r\n'b'these transformations is known. Now fuel, wood or coal, was ready for\r\n'b'immediate use, an oven must be built to use it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is this oven for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo make the pottery which we have need of,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd of what shall we make the oven?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith bricks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the bricks?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith clay. Let us start, my friends. To save trouble, we will establish\r\n'b'our manufactory at the place of production. Neb will bring provisions,\r\n'b'and there will be no lack of fire to cook the food.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if there is a lack of food for want of\r\n'b'instruments for the chase?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if we only had a knife!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I would soon make a bow and arrows, and then there could be\r\n'b'plenty of game in the larder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a knife, a sharp blade.\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, as if he was speaking\r\n'b'to himself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this moment his eyes fell upon Top, who was running about on the\r\n'b'shore. Suddenly Harding\xe2\x80\x99s face became animated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop, here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The dog came at his master\xe2\x80\x99s call. The latter took Top\xe2\x80\x99s head between\r\n'b'his hands, and unfastening the collar which the animal wore round his\r\n'b'neck, he broke it in two, saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are two knives, Pencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two hurrahs from the sailor was the reply. Top\xe2\x80\x99s collar was made of a\r\n'b'thin piece of tempered steel. They had only to sharpen it on a piece of\r\n'b'sandstone, then to raise the edge on a finer stone. Now sandstone was\r\n'b'abundant on the beach, and two hours after the stock of tools in the\r\n'b'colony consisted of two sharp blades, which were easily fixed in solid\r\n'b'handles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The production of these their first tools was hailed as a triumph. It\r\n'b'was indeed a valuable result of their labor, and a very opportune one.\r\n'b'They set out.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding proposed that they should return to the western shore of\r\n'b'the lake, where the day before he had noticed the clayey ground of which\r\n'b'he possessed a specimen. They therefore followed the bank of the Mercy,\r\n'b'traversed Prospect Heights, and after a walk of five miles or more they\r\n'b'reached a glade, situated two hundred feet from Lake Grant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the way Herbert had discovered a tree, the branches of which the\r\n'b'Indians of South America employ for making their bows. It was the\r\n'b'crejimba, of the palm family, which does not bear edible fruit. Long\r\n'b'straight branches were cut, the leaves stripped off; it was shaped,\r\n'b'stronger in the middle, more slender at the extremities, and nothing\r\n'b'remained to be done but to find a plant fit to make the bow-string.\r\n'b'This was the \xe2\x80\x9chibiscus heterophyllus,\xe2\x80\x9d which furnishes fibers of such\r\n'b'remarkable tenacity that they have been compared to the tendons of\r\n'b'animals. Pencroft thus obtained bows of tolerable strength, for which he\r\n'b'only wanted arrows. These were easily made with straight stiff branches,\r\n'b'without knots, but the points with which they must be armed, that is\r\n'b'to say, a substance to serve in lieu of iron, could not be met with so\r\n'b'easily. But Pencroft said, that having done his part of the work, chance\r\n'b'would do the rest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers arrived on the ground which had been discovered the day\r\n'b'before. Being composed of the sort of clay which is used for making\r\n'b'bricks and tiles, it was very useful for the work in question. There was\r\n'b'no great difficulty in it. It was enough to scour the clay with sand,\r\n'b'then to mold the bricks and bake them by the heat of a wood fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Generally bricks are formed in molds, but the engineer contented himself\r\n'b'with making them by hand. All that day and the day following were\r\n'b'employed in this work. The clay, soaked in water, was mixed by the feet\r\n'b'and hands of the manipulators, and then divided into pieces of equal\r\n'b'size. A practiced workman can make, without a machine, about ten\r\n'b'thousand bricks in twelve hours; but in their two days work the five\r\n'b'brickmakers on Lincoln Island had not made more than three thousand,\r\n'b'which were ranged near each other, until the time when their complete\r\n'b'desiccation would permit them to be used in building the oven, that is\r\n'b'to say, in three or four days.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was on the 2nd of April that Harding had employed himself in fixing\r\n'b'the orientation of the island, or, in other words, the precise spot\r\n'b'where the sun rose. The day before he had noted exactly the hour when\r\n'b'the sun disappeared beneath the horizon, making allowance for the\r\n'b'refraction. This morning he noted, no less exactly, the hour at which\r\n'b'it reappeared. Between this setting and rising twelve hours, twenty-four\r\n'b'minutes passed. Then, six hours, twelve minutes after its rising, the\r\n'b'sun on this day would exactly pass the meridian and the point of the sky\r\n'b'which it occupied at this moment would be the north. At the said hour,\r\n'b'Cyrus marked this point, and putting in a line with the sun two trees\r\n'b'which would serve him for marks, he thus obtained an invariable meridian\r\n'b'for his ulterior operations.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers employed the two days before the oven was built in\r\n'b'collecting fuel. Branches were cut all round the glade, and they picked\r\n'b'up all the fallen wood under the trees. They were also able to hunt with\r\n'b'greater success, since Pencroft now possessed some dozen arrows armed\r\n'b'with sharp points. It was Top who had furnished these points, by bringing\r\n'b'in a porcupine, rather inferior eating, but of great value, thanks to\r\n'b'the quills with which it bristled. These quills were fixed firmly at the\r\n'b'ends of the arrows, the flight of which was made more certain by some\r\n'b'cockatoos\xe2\x80\x99 feathers. The reporter and Herbert soon became very skilful\r\n'b'archers. Game of all sorts in consequence abounded at the Chimneys,\r\n'b'capybaras, pigeons, agouties, grouse, etc. The greater part of these\r\n'b'animals were killed in the part of the forest on the left bank of the\r\n'b'Mercy, to which they gave the name of Jacamar Wood, in remembrance of\r\n'b'the bird which Pencroft and Herbert had pursued when on their first\r\n'b'exploration.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This game was eaten fresh, but they preserved some capybara hams, by\r\n'b'smoking them above a fire of green wood, after having perfumed them with\r\n'b'sweet-smelling leaves. However, this food, although very strengthening,\r\n'b'was always roast upon roast, and the party would have been delighted\r\n'b'to hear some soup bubbling on the hearth, but they must wait till a pot\r\n'b'could be made, and, consequently, till the oven was built.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During these excursions, which were not extended far from the\r\n'b'brick-field, the hunters could discern the recent passage of animals of\r\n'b'a large size, armed with powerful claws, but they could not recognize\r\n'b'the species. Cyrus Harding advised them to be very careful, as the\r\n'b'forest probably enclosed many dangerous beasts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And he did right. Indeed, Gideon Spilett and Herbert one day saw an\r\n'b'animal which resembled a jaguar. Happily the creature did not attack\r\n'b'them, or they might not have escaped without a severe wound. As soon\r\n'b'as he could get a regular weapon, that is to say, one of the guns which\r\n'b'Pencroft begged for, Gideon Spilett resolved to make desperate war\r\n'b'against the ferocious beasts, and exterminate them from the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The Chimneys during these few days was not made more comfortable, for\r\n'b'the engineer hoped to discover, or build if necessary, a more convenient\r\n'b'dwelling. They contented themselves with spreading moss and dry leaves\r\n'b'on the sand of the passages, and on these primitive couches the tired\r\n'b'workers slept soundly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They also reckoned the days they had passed on Lincoln Island, and from\r\n'b'that time kept a regular account. The 5th of April, which was Wednesday,\r\n'b'was twelve days from the time when the wind threw the castaways on this\r\n'b'shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 6th of April, at daybreak, the engineer and his companions were\r\n'b'collected in the glade, at the place where they were going to perform\r\n'b'the operation of baking the bricks. Naturally this had to be in the open\r\n'b'air, and not in a kiln, or rather, the agglomeration of bricks made an\r\n'b'enormous kiln, which would bake itself. The fuel, made of well-prepared\r\n'b'fagots, was laid on the ground and surrounded with several rows of dried\r\n'b'bricks, which soon formed an enormous cube, to the exterior of which\r\n'b'they contrived air-holes. The work lasted all day, and it was not till\r\n'b'the evening that they set fire to the fagots. No one slept that night,\r\n'b'all watching carefully to keep up the fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The operation lasted forty-eight hours, and succeeded perfectly. It then\r\n'b'became necessary to leave the smoking mass to cool, and during this time\r\n'b'Neb and Pencroft, guided by Cyrus Harding, brought, on a hurdle made of\r\n'b'interlaced branches, loads of carbonate of lime and common stones,\r\n'b'which were very abundant, to the north of the lake. These stones, when\r\n'b'decomposed by heat, made a very strong quicklime, greatly increased by\r\n'b'slacking, at least as pure as if it had been produced by the calcination\r\n'b'of chalk or marble. Mixed with sand the lime made excellent mortar.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The result of these different works was, that, on the 9th of April,\r\n'b'the engineer had at his disposal a quantity of prepared lime and some\r\n'b'thousands of bricks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Without losing an instant, therefore, they began the construction of\r\n'b'a kiln to bake the pottery, which was indispensable for their domestic\r\n'b'use. They succeeded without much difficulty. Five days after, the kiln\r\n'b'was supplied with coal, which the engineer had discovered lying open to\r\n'b'the sky towards the mouth of the Red Creek, and the first smoke escaped\r\n'b'from a chimney twenty feet high. The glade was transformed into a\r\n'b'manufactory, and Pencroft was not far wrong in believing that from this\r\n'b'kiln would issue all the products of modern industry.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meantime what the settlers first manufactured was a common\r\n'b'pottery in which to cook their food. The chief material was clay, to\r\n'b'which Harding added a little lime and quartz. This paste made regular\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cpipe-clay,\xe2\x80\x9d with which they manufactured bowls, cups molded on stones\r\n'b'of a proper size, great jars and pots to hold water, etc. The shape of\r\n'b'these objects was clumsy and defective, but after they had been baked\r\n'b'in a high temperature, the kitchen of the Chimneys was provided with a\r\n'b'number of utensils, as precious to the settlers as the most beautifully\r\n'b'enameled china. We must mention here that Pencroft, desirous to know if\r\n'b'the clay thus prepared was worthy of its name of pipe-clay, made some\r\n'b'large pipes, which he thought charming, but for which, alas! he had no\r\n'b'tobacco, and that was a great privation to Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cBut tobacco\r\n'b'will come, like everything else!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, in a burst of absolute\r\n'b'confidence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This work lasted till the 15th of April, and the time was well employed.\r\n'b'The settlers, having become potters, made nothing but pottery. When\r\n'b'it suited Cyrus Harding to change them into smiths, they would become\r\n'b'smiths. But the next day being Sunday, and also Easter Sunday, all\r\n'b'agreed to sanctify the day by rest. These Americans were religious men,\r\n'b'scrupulous observers of the precepts of the Bible, and their situation\r\n'b'could not but develop sentiments of confidence towards the Author of all\r\n'b'things.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the evening of the 15th of April they returned to the Chimneys,\r\n'b'carrying with them the pottery, the furnace being extinguished until\r\n'b'they could put it to a new use. Their return was marked by a fortunate\r\n'b'incident; the engineer discovered a substance which replaced tinder.\r\n'b'It is known that a spongy, velvety flesh is procured from a certain\r\n'b'mushroom of the genus polyporous. Properly prepared, it is extremely\r\n'b'inflammable, especially when it has been previously saturated with\r\n'b'gunpowder, or boiled in a solution of nitrate or chlorate of potash.\r\n'b'But, till then, they had not found any of these polypores or even any of\r\n'b'the morels which could replace them. On this day, the engineer, seeing\r\n'b'a plant belonging to the wormwood genus, the principal species of which\r\n'b'are absinthe, balm-mint, tarragon, etc., gathered several tufts, and,\r\n'b'presenting them to the sailor, said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Pencroft, this will please you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft looked attentively at the plant, covered with long silky hair,\r\n'b'the leaves being clothed with soft down.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s that, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it tobacco?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cit is wormwood; Chinese wormwood to the learned,\r\n'b'but to us it will be tinder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When the wormwood was properly dried it provided them with a very\r\n'b'inflammable substance, especially afterwards when the engineer had\r\n'b'impregnated it with nitrate of potash, of which the island possessed\r\n'b'several beds, and which is in truth saltpeter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists had a good supper that evening. Neb prepared some agouti\r\n'b'soup, a smoked capybara ham, to which was added the boiled tubercules of\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x9ccaladium macrorhizum,\xe2\x80\x9d an herbaceous plant of the arum family.\r\n'b'They had an excellent taste, and were very nutritious, being something\r\n'b'similar to the substance which is sold in England under the name of\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPortland sago\xe2\x80\x9d; they were also a good substitute for bread, which the\r\n'b'settlers in Lincoln Island did not yet possess.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When supper was finished, before sleeping, Harding and his companions\r\n'b'went to take the air on the beach. It was eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening;\r\n'b'the night was magnificent. The moon, which had been full five days\r\n'b'before, had not yet risen, but the horizon was already silvered by those\r\n'b'soft, pale shades which might be called the dawn of the moon. At the\r\n'b'southern zenith glittered the circumpolar constellations, and above all\r\n'b'the Southern Cross, which some days before the engineer had greeted on\r\n'b'the summit of Mount Franklin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding gazed for some time at this splendid constellation, which\r\n'b'has at its summit and at its base two stars of the first magnitude, at\r\n'b'its left arm a star of the second, and at its right arm a star of the\r\n'b'third magnitude.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, after some minutes thought--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked of the lad, \xe2\x80\x9cis not this the 15th of April?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if I am not mistaken, to-morrow will be one of the four days in\r\n'b'the year in which the real time is identical with average time; that\r\n'b'is to say, my boy, that to-morrow, to within some seconds, the sun will\r\n'b'pass the meridian just at midday by the clocks. If the weather is fine\r\n'b'I think that I shall obtain the longitude of the island with an\r\n'b'approximation of some degrees.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWithout instruments, without sextant?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cAlso, since the night is clear, I will\r\n'b'try, this very evening, to obtain our latitude by calculating the\r\n'b'height of the Southern Cross, that is, from the southern pole above the\r\n'b'horizon. You understand, my friends, that before undertaking the work\r\n'b'of installation in earnest it is not enough to have found out that this\r\n'b'land is an island; we must, as nearly as possible, know at what distance\r\n'b'it is situated, either from the American continent or Australia, or from\r\n'b'the principal archipelagoes of the Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of building a house it would\r\n'b'be more important to build a boat, if by chance we are not more than a\r\n'b'hundred miles from an inhabited coast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is why,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going to try this evening to\r\n'b'calculate the latitude of Lincoln Island, and to-morrow, at midday, I\r\n'b'will try to calculate the longitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'If the engineer had possessed a sextant, an apparatus with which the\r\n'b'angular distance of objects can be measured with great precision, there\r\n'b'would have been no difficulty in the operation. This evening by the\r\n'b'height of the pole, the next day by the passing of the sun at the\r\n'b'meridian, he would obtain the position of the island. But as they had\r\n'b'not one he would have to supply the deficiency.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding then entered the Chimneys. By the light of the fire he cut two\r\n'b'little flat rulers, which he joined together at one end so as to form\r\n'b'a pair of compasses, whose legs could separate or come together. The\r\n'b'fastening was fixed with a strong acacia thorn which was found in the\r\n'b'wood pile. This instrument finished, the engineer returned to the beach,\r\n'b'but as it was necessary to take the height of the pole from above a\r\n'b'clear horizon, that is, a sea horizon, and as Claw Cape hid the southern\r\n'b'horizon, he was obliged to look for a more suitable station. The best\r\n'b'would evidently have been the shore exposed directly to the south; but\r\n'b'the Mercy would have to be crossed, and that was a difficulty. Harding\r\n'b'resolved, in consequence, to make his observation from Prospect Heights,\r\n'b'taking into consideration its height above the level of the sea--a\r\n'b'height which he intended to calculate next day by a simple process of\r\n'b'elementary geometry.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers, therefore, went to the plateau, ascending the left bank of\r\n'b'the Mercy, and placed themselves on the edge which looked northwest and\r\n'b'southeast, that is, above the curiously-shaped rocks which bordered the\r\n'b'river.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This part of the plateau commanded the heights of the left bank, which\r\n'b'sloped away to the extremity of Claw Cape, and to the southern side of\r\n'b'the island. No obstacle intercepted their gaze, which swept the horizon\r\n'b'in a semi-circle from the cape to Reptile End. To the south the horizon,\r\n'b'lighted by the first rays of the moon, was very clearly defined against\r\n'b'the sky.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this moment the Southern Cross presented itself to the observer in an\r\n'b'inverted position, the star Alpha marking its base, which is nearer to\r\n'b'the southern pole.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This constellation is not situated as near to the antarctic pole as the\r\n'b'Polar Star is to the arctic pole. The star Alpha is about twenty-seven\r\n'b'degrees from it, but Cyrus Harding knew this and made allowance for\r\n'b'it in his calculation. He took care also to observe the moment when it\r\n'b'passed the meridian below the pole, which would simplify the operation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding pointed one leg of the compasses to the horizon, the\r\n'b'other to Alpha, and the space between the two legs gave him the angular\r\n'b'distance which separated Alpha from the horizon. In order to fix the\r\n'b'angle obtained, he fastened with thorns the two pieces of wood on a\r\n'b'third placed transversely, so that their separation should be properly\r\n'b'maintained.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That done, there was only the angle to calculate by bringing back the\r\n'b'observation to the level of the sea, taking into consideration the\r\n'b'depression of the horizon, which would necessitate measuring the height\r\n'b'of the cliff. The value of this angle would give the height of Alpha,\r\n'b'and consequently that of the pole above the horizon, that is to say, the\r\n'b'latitude of the island, since the latitude of a point of the globe is\r\n'b'always equal to the height of the pole above the horizon of this point.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The calculations were left for the next day, and at ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock every\r\n'b'one was sleeping soundly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 14\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 16th of April, and Easter Sunday, the settlers issued\r\n'b'from the Chimneys at daybreak, and proceeded to wash their linen. The\r\n'b'engineer intended to manufacture soap as soon as he could procure the\r\n'b'necessary materials--soda or potash, fat or oil. The important question\r\n'b'of renewing their wardrobe would be treated of in the proper time and\r\n'b'place. At any rate their clothes would last at least six months longer,\r\n'b'for they were strong, and could resist the wear of manual labor. But\r\n'b'all would depend on the situation of the island with regard to inhabited\r\n'b'land. This would be settled to-day if the weather permitted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sun rising above a clear horizon, announced a magnificent day, one\r\n'b'of those beautiful autumn days which are like the last farewells of the\r\n'b'warm season.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now necessary to complete the observations of the evening before\r\n'b'by measuring the height of the cliff above the level of the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShall you not need an instrument similar to the one which you used\r\n'b'yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert to the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the latter, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are going to proceed differently,\r\n'b'but in as precise a way.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert, wishing to learn everything he could, followed the engineer to\r\n'b'the beach. Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter remained behind and occupied\r\n'b'themselves in different ways.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had provided himself with a straight stick, twelve feet\r\n'b'long, which he had measured as exactly as possible by comparing it with\r\n'b'his own height, which he knew to a hair. Herbert carried a plumb-line\r\n'b'which Harding had given him, that is to say, a simple stone fastened\r\n'b'to the end of a flexible fiber. Having reached a spot about twenty feet\r\n'b'from the edge of the beach, and nearly five hundred feet from the cliff,\r\n'b'which rose perpendicularly, Harding thrust the pole two feet into\r\n'b'the sand, and wedging it up carefully, he managed, by means of the\r\n'b'plumb-line, to erect it perpendicularly with the plane of the horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That done, he retired the necessary distance, when, lying on the sand,\r\n'b'his eye glanced at the same time at the top of the pole and the crest of\r\n'b'the cliff. He carefully marked the place with a little stick.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then addressing Herbert--\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know the first principles of geometry?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' he asked.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSlightly, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, who did not wish to put himself\r\n'b'forward.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou remember what are the properties of two similar triangles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9ctheir homologous sides are proportional.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy, I have just constructed two similar right-angled\r\n'b'triangles; the first, the smallest, has for its sides the perpendicular\r\n'b'pole, the distance which separates the little stick from the foot of the\r\n'b'pole and my visual ray for hypothenuse; the second has for its sides\r\n'b'the perpendicular cliff, the height of which we wish to measure, the\r\n'b'distance which separates the little stick from the bottom of the\r\n'b'cliff, and my visual ray also forms its hypothenuse, which proves to be\r\n'b'prolongation of that of the first triangle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh, captain, I understand!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cAs the distance from the\r\n'b'stick to the pole is to the distance from the stick to the base of the\r\n'b'cliff, so is the height of the pole to the height of the cliff.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJust so, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cand when we have measured the\r\n'b'two first distances, knowing the height of the pole, we shall only have\r\n'b'a sum in proportion to do, which will give us the height of the cliff,\r\n'b'and will save us the trouble of measuring it directly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The two horizontal distances were found out by means of the pole, whose\r\n'b'length above the sand was exactly ten feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first distance was fifteen feet between the stick and the place\r\n'b'where the pole was thrust into the sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The second distance between the stick and the bottom of the cliff was\r\n'b'five hundred feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These measurements finished, Cyrus Harding and the lad returned to the\r\n'b'Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer then took a flat stone which he had brought back from one\r\n'b'of his previous excursions, a sort of slate, on which it was easy\r\n'b'to trace figures with a sharp shell. He then proved the following\r\n'b'proportions:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'          15:500::10:x\r\n'b'\r\n'b'         500 x 10 = 5000\r\n'b'\r\n'b'        5000 / 15 = 333.3\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From which it was proved that the granite cliff measured 333 feet in\r\n'b'height.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding then took the instrument which he had made the evening\r\n'b'before, the space between its two legs giving the angular distance\r\n'b'between the star Alpha and the horizon. He measured, very exactly, the\r\n'b'opening of this angle on a circumference which he divided into 360 equal\r\n'b'parts. Now, this angle by adding to it the twenty-seven degrees which\r\n'b'separated Alpha from the antarctic pole, and by reducing to the level of\r\n'b'the sea the height of the cliff on which the observation had been made,\r\n'b'was found to be fifty-three degrees. These fifty-three degrees being\r\n'b'subtracted from ninety degrees--the distance from the pole to the\r\n'b'equator--there remained thirty-seven degrees. Cyrus Harding concluded,\r\n'b'therefore, that Lincoln Island was situated on the thirty-seventh degree\r\n'b'of the southern latitude, or taking into consideration through the\r\n'b'imperfection of the performance, an error of five degrees, that it must\r\n'b'be situated between the thirty-fifth and the fortieth parallel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was only the longitude to be obtained, and the position of the\r\n'b'island would be determined, The engineer hoped to attempt this the same\r\n'b'day, at twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at which moment the sun would pass the meridian.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was decided that Sunday should be spent in a walk, or rather an\r\n'b'exploring expedition, to that side of the island between the north of\r\n'b'the lake and Shark Gulf, and if there was time they would push their\r\n'b'discoveries to the northern side of Cape South Mandible. They would\r\n'b'breakfast on the downs, and not return till evening.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At half-past eight the little band was following the edge of the\r\n'b'channel. On the other side, on Safety Islet, numerous birds were gravely\r\n'b'strutting. They were divers, easily recognized by their cry, which much\r\n'b'resembles the braying of a donkey. Pencroft only considered them in\r\n'b'an eatable point of view, and learnt with some satisfaction that their\r\n'b'flesh, though blackish, is not bad food.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Great amphibious creatures could also be seen crawling on the sand;\r\n'b'seals, doubtless, who appeared to have chosen the islet for a place of\r\n'b'refuge. It was impossible to think of those animals in an alimentary\r\n'b'point of view, for their oily flesh is detestable; however, Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding observed them attentively, and without making known his idea, he\r\n'b'announced to his companions that very soon they would pay a visit to the\r\n'b'islet. The beach was strewn with innumerable shells, some of which would\r\n'b'have rejoiced the heart of a conchologist; there were, among others, the\r\n'b'phasianella, the terebratual, etc. But what would be of more use, was\r\n'b'the discovery, by Neb, at low tide, of a large oysterbed among the\r\n'b'rocks, nearly five miles from the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNeb will not have lost his day,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, looking at the\r\n'b'spacious oyster-bed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is really a fortunate discovery,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand as it is\r\n'b'said that each oyster produces yearly from fifty to sixty thousand eggs,\r\n'b'we shall have an inexhaustible supply there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnly I believe that the oyster is not very nourishing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cThe oyster contains very little nitrogen, and\r\n'b'if a man lived exclusively on them, he would have to eat not less than\r\n'b'fifteen to sixteen dozen a day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cWe might swallow dozens and dozens without\r\n'b'exhausting the bed. Shall we take some for breakfast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And without waiting for a reply to this proposal, knowing that it would\r\n'b'be approved of, the sailor and Neb detached a quantity of the molluscs.\r\n'b'They put them in a sort of net of hibiscus fiber, which Neb had\r\n'b'manufactured, and which already contained food; they then continued to\r\n'b'climb the coast between the downs and the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From time to time Harding consulted his watch, so as to be prepared in\r\n'b'time for the solar observation, which had to be made exactly at midday.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All that part of the island was very barren as far as the point\r\n'b'which closed Union Bay, and which had received the name of Cape South\r\n'b'Mandible. Nothing could be seen there but sand and shells, mingled with\r\n'b'debris of lava. A few sea-birds frequented this desolate coast, gulls,\r\n'b'great albatrosses, as well as wild duck, for which Pencroft had a great\r\n'b'fancy. He tried to knock some over with an arrow, but without result,\r\n'b'for they seldom perched, and he could not hit them on the wing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This led the sailor to repeat to the engineer,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, captain, so long as we have not one or two fowling-pieces, we\r\n'b'shall never get anything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it depends on you.\r\n'b'Procure us some iron for the barrels, steel for the hammers, saltpeter.\r\n'b'coal and sulphur for powder, mercury and nitric acid for the fulminate,\r\n'b'and lead for the shot, and the captain will make us first-rate guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe might, no doubt, find all these\r\n'b'substances on the island, but a gun is a delicate instrument, and needs\r\n'b'very particular tools. However, we shall see later!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwere we obliged to throw overboard all the\r\n'b'weapons we had with us in the car, all our implements, even our\r\n'b'pocket-knives?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut if we had not thrown them away, Pencroft, the balloon would have\r\n'b'thrown us to the bottom of the sea!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat you say is true, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then passing to another idea,--\xe2\x80\x9cThink,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9chow astounded Jonathan\r\n'b'Forster and his companions must have been when, next morning, they found\r\n'b'the place empty, and the machine flown away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am utterly indifferent about knowing what they may have thought,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was all my idea, that!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, with a satisfied air.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA splendid idea, Pencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\n'b'which has placed us where we are.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would rather be here than in the hands of the Southerners,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\n'b'sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially since the captain has been kind enough to come and\r\n'b'join us again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo would I, truly!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, what do we want?\r\n'b'Nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf that is not--everything!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, laughing and shrugging\r\n'b'his shoulders. \xe2\x80\x9cBut, some day or other, we shall find means of going\r\n'b'away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSooner, perhaps, than you imagine, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the engineer,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cif Lincoln Island is but a medium distance from an inhabited island,\r\n'b'or from a continent. We shall know in an hour. I have not a map of the\r\n'b'Pacific, but my memory has preserved a very clear recollection of\r\n'b'its southern part. The latitude which I obtained yesterday placed New\r\n'b'Zealand to the west of Lincoln Island, and the coast of Chile to the\r\n'b'east. But between these two countries, there is a distance of at least\r\n'b'six thousand miles. It has, therefore, to be determined what point in\r\n'b'this great space the island occupies, and this the longitude will give\r\n'b'us presently, with a sufficient approximation, I hope.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs not the archipelago of the Pomoutous the nearest point to us in\r\n'b'latitude?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the distance which separates us from\r\n'b'it is more than twelve hundred miles.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that way?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb, who followed the conversation with extreme\r\n'b'interest, pointing to the south.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat way, nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d added the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cif Lincoln Island is not more than\r\n'b'two or three thousand miles from New Zealand or Chile?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of building a house we will build\r\n'b'a boat, and Master Pencroft shall be put in command--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell then,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI am quite ready to be captain--as soon\r\n'b'as you can make a craft that\xe2\x80\x99s able to keep at sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall do it, if it is necessary,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But while these men, who really hesitated at nothing, were talking,\r\n'b'the hour approached at which the observation was to be made. What Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding was to do to ascertain the passage of the sun at the meridian of\r\n'b'the island, without an instrument of any sort, Herbert could not guess.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The observers were then about six miles from the Chimneys, not far from\r\n'b'that part of the downs in which the engineer had been found after his\r\n'b'enigmatical preservation. They halted at this place and prepared for\r\n'b'breakfast, for it was half-past eleven. Herbert went for some fresh\r\n'b'water from a stream which ran near, and brought it back in a jug, which\r\n'b'Neb had provided.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During these preparations Harding arranged everything for his\r\n'b'astronomical observation. He chose a clear place on the shore, which\r\n'b'the ebbing tide had left perfectly level. This bed of fine sand was as\r\n'b'smooth as ice, not a grain out of place. It was of little importance\r\n'b'whether it was horizontal or not, and it did not matter much whether the\r\n'b'stick six feet high, which was planted there, rose perpendicularly. On\r\n'b'the contrary, the engineer inclined it towards the south, that is to\r\n'b'say, in the direction of the coast opposite to the sun, for it must\r\n'b'not be forgotten that the settlers in Lincoln Island, as the island was\r\n'b'situated in the Southern Hemisphere, saw the radiant planet describe its\r\n'b'diurnal arc above the northern, and not above the southern horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert now understood how the engineer was going to proceed to\r\n'b'ascertain the culmination of the sun, that is to say its passing the\r\n'b'meridian of the island or, in other words, determine due south. It was\r\n'b'by means of the shadow cast on the sand by the stick, a way which, for\r\n'b'want of an instrument, would give him a suitable approach to the result\r\n'b'which he wished to obtain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, the moment when this shadow would reach its minimum of length\r\n'b'would be exactly twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and it would be enough to watch the\r\n'b'extremity of the shadow, so as to ascertain the instant when, after\r\n'b'having successively diminished, it began to lengthen. By inclining his\r\n'b'stick to the side opposite to the sun, Cyrus Harding made the shadow\r\n'b'longer, and consequently its modifications would be more easily\r\n'b'ascertained. In fact, the longer the needle of a dial is, the more\r\n'b'easily can the movement of its point be followed. The shadow of the\r\n'b'stick was nothing but the needle of a dial. The moment had come, and\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding knelt on the sand, and with little wooden pegs, which he\r\n'b'stuck into the sand, he began to mark the successive diminutions of the\r\n'b'stick\xe2\x80\x99s shadow. His companions, bending over him, watched the operation\r\n'b'with extreme interest. The reporter held his chronometer in his hand,\r\n'b'ready to tell the hour which it marked when the shadow would be at its\r\n'b'shortest. Moreover, as Cyrus Harding was working on the 16th of April,\r\n'b'the day on which the true and the average time are identical, the hour\r\n'b'given by Gideon Spilett would be the true hour then at Washington, which\r\n'b'would simplify the calculation. Meanwhile as the sun slowly advanced,\r\n'b'the shadow slowly diminished, and when it appeared to Cyrus Harding that\r\n'b'it was beginning to increase, he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cWhat o\xe2\x80\x99clock is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne minute past five,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett directly. They had now\r\n'b'only to calculate the operation. Nothing could be easier. It could be\r\n'b'seen that there existed, in round numbers, a difference of five hours\r\n'b'between the meridian of Washington and that of Lincoln Island, that is\r\n'b'to say, it was midday in Lincoln Island when it was already five o\xe2\x80\x99clock\r\n'b'in the evening in Washington. Now the sun, in its apparent movement\r\n'b'round the earth, traverses one degree in four minutes, or fifteen\r\n'b'degrees an hour. Fifteen degrees multiplied by five hours give\r\n'b'seventy-five degrees.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, since Washington is 77deg 3\xe2\x80\x99 11\xe2\x80\x9d as much as to say seventy-seven\r\n'b'degrees counted from the meridian of Greenwich which the Americans\r\n'b'take for their starting-point for longitudes concurrently with the\r\n'b'English--it followed that the island must be situated seventy-seven and\r\n'b'seventy-five degrees west of the meridian of Greenwich, that is to say,\r\n'b'on the hundred and fifty-second degree of west longitude.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding announced this result to his companions, and taking into\r\n'b'consideration errors of observation, as he had done for the latitude, he\r\n'b'believed he could positively affirm that the position of Lincoln Island\r\n'b'was between the thirty-fifth and the thirty-seventh parallel, and\r\n'b'between the hundred and fiftieth and the hundred and fifty-fifth\r\n'b'meridian to the west of the meridian of Greenwich.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The possible fault which he attributed to errors in the observation was,\r\n'b'it may be seen, of five degrees on both sides, which, at sixty miles\r\n'b'to a degree, would give an error of three hundred miles in latitude and\r\n'b'longitude for the exact position.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But this error would not influence the determination which it was\r\n'b'necessary to take. It was very evident that Lincoln Island was at such a\r\n'b'distance from every country or island that it would be too hazardous to\r\n'b'attempt to reach one in a frail boat.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, this calculation placed it at least twelve hundred miles from\r\n'b'Tahiti and the islands of the archipelago of the Pomoutous, more than\r\n'b'eighteen hundred miles from New Zealand, and more than four thousand\r\n'b'five hundred miles from the American coast!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And when Cyrus Harding consulted his memory, he could not remember in\r\n'b'any way that such an island occupied, in that part of the Pacific, the\r\n'b'situation assigned to Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 15\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 17th of April, the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s first words were addressed\r\n'b'to Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat shall we do to-day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat the captain pleases,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Till then the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s companions had been brickmakers and potters,\r\n'b'now they were to become metallurgists.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The day before, after breakfast, they had explored as far as the point\r\n'b'of Mandible Cape, seven miles distant from the Chimneys. There, the long\r\n'b'series of downs ended, and the soil had a volcanic appearance. There\r\n'b'were no longer high cliffs as at Prospect Heights, but a strange and\r\n'b'capricious border which surrounded the narrow gulf between the two\r\n'b'capes, formed of mineral matter, thrown up by the volcano. Arrived at\r\n'b'this point the settlers retraced their steps, and at nightfall entered\r\n'b'the Chimneys; but they did not sleep before the question of knowing\r\n'b'whether they could think of leaving Lincoln Island or not was definitely\r\n'b'settled.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The twelve hundred miles which separated the island from the Pomoutous\r\n'b'Island was a considerable distance. A boat could not cross it,\r\n'b'especially at the approach of the bad season. Pencroft had expressly\r\n'b'declared this. Now, to construct a simple boat even with the necessary\r\n'b'tools, was a difficult work, and the colonists not having tools they\r\n'b'must begin by making hammers, axes, adzes, saws, augers, planes, etc.,\r\n'b'which would take some time. It was decided, therefore, that they\r\n'b'would winter at Lincoln Island, and that they would look for a more\r\n'b'comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys, in which to pass the winter\r\n'b'months.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Before anything else could be done it was necessary to make the iron\r\n'b'ore, of which the engineer had observed some traces in the northwest\r\n'b'part of the island, fit for use by converting it either into iron or\r\n'b'into steel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Metals are not generally found in the ground in a pure state. For the\r\n'b'most part they are combined with oxygen or sulphur. Such was the case\r\n'b'with the two specimens which Cyrus Harding had brought back, one of\r\n'b'magnetic iron, not carbonated, the other a pyrite, also called sulphuret\r\n'b'of iron. It was, therefore the first, the oxide of iron, which they must\r\n'b'reduce with coal, that is to say, get rid of the oxygen, to obtain it in\r\n'b'a pure state. This reduction is made by subjecting the ore with coal to\r\n'b'a high temperature, either by the rapid and easy Catalan method,\r\n'b'which has the advantage of transforming the ore into iron in a single\r\n'b'operation, or by the blast furnace, which first smelts the ore, then\r\n'b'changes it into iron, by carrying away the three to four per cent. of\r\n'b'coal, which is combined with it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now Cyrus Harding wanted iron, and he wished to obtain it as soon as\r\n'b'possible. The ore which he had picked up was in itself very pure and\r\n'b'rich. It was the oxydulous iron, which is found in confused masses of a\r\n'b'deep gray color; it gives a black dust, crystallized in the form of the\r\n'b'regular octahedron. Native lodestones consist of this ore, and iron\r\n'b'of the first quality is made in Europe from that with which Sweden and\r\n'b'Norway are so abundantly supplied. Not far from this vein was the vein\r\n'b'of coal already made use of by the settlers. The ingredients for the\r\n'b'manufacture being close together would greatly facilitate the treatment\r\n'b'of the ore. This is the cause of the wealth of the mines in Great\r\n'b'Britain, where the coal aids the manufacture of the metal extracted from\r\n'b'the same soil at the same time as itself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are going to work iron ore?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand for that--something which\r\n'b'will please you--we must begin by having a seal hunt on the islet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA seal hunt!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor, turning towards Gideon Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cAre\r\n'b'seals needed to make iron?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSince Cyrus has said so!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the engineer had already left the Chimneys, and Pencroft prepared\r\n'b'for the seal hunt, without having received any other explanation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, Herbert, Gideon Spilett, Neb, and the sailor were\r\n'b'soon collected on the shore, at a place where the channel left a ford\r\n'b'passable at low tide. The hunters could therefore traverse it without\r\n'b'getting wet higher than the knee.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding then put his foot on the islet for the first, and his companions\r\n'b'for the second time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On their landing some hundreds of penguins looked fearlessly at them.\r\n'b'The hunters, armed with sticks, could have killed them easily, but they\r\n'b'were not guilty of such useless massacre, as it was important not to\r\n'b'frighten the seals, who were lying on the sand several cable lengths\r\n'b'off. They also respected certain innocent-looking birds, whose wings\r\n'b'were reduced to the state of stumps, spread out like fins, ornamented\r\n'b'with feathers of a scaly appearance. The settlers, therefore, prudently\r\n'b'advanced towards the north point, walking over ground riddled with\r\n'b'little holes, which formed nests for the sea-birds. Towards the\r\n'b'extremity of the islet appeared great black heads floating just above\r\n'b'the water, having exactly the appearance of rocks in motion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These were the seals which were to be captured. It was necessary,\r\n'b'however, first to allow them to land, for with their close, short\r\n'b'hair, and their fusiform conformation, being excellent swimmers, it is\r\n'b'difficult to catch them in the sea, while on land their short, webbed\r\n'b'feet prevent their having more than a slow, waddling movement.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft knew the habits of these creatures, and he advised waiting till\r\n'b'they were stretched on the sand, when the sun, before long, would send\r\n'b'them to sleep. They must then manage to cut off their retreat and knock\r\n'b'them on the head.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The hunters, having concealed themselves behind the rocks, waited\r\n'b'silently.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An hour passed before the seals came to play on the sand. They could\r\n'b'count half a dozen. Pencroft and Herbert then went round the point of\r\n'b'the islet, so as to take them in the rear, and cut off their retreat.\r\n'b'During this time Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and Neb, crawling behind the\r\n'b'rocks, glided towards the future scene of combat.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All at once the tall figure of the sailor appeared. Pencroft shouted.\r\n'b'The engineer and his two companions threw themselves between the sea and\r\n'b'the seals. Two of the animals soon lay dead on the sand, but the rest\r\n'b'regained the sea in safety.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere are the seals required, captain!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, advancing\r\n'b'towards the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCapital,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will make bellows of them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBellows!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cWell! these are lucky seals!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was, in fact, a blowing-machine, necessary for the treatment of\r\n'b'the ore that the engineer wished to manufacture with the skins of the\r\n'b'amphibious creatures. They were of a medium size, for their length did\r\n'b'not exceed six feet. They resembled a dog about the head.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As it was useless to burden themselves with the weight of both the\r\n'b'animals, Neb and Pencroft resolved to skin them on the spot, while Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding and the reporter continued to explore the islet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor and the Negro cleverly performed the operation, and three\r\n'b'hours afterwards Cyrus Harding had at his disposal two seals\xe2\x80\x99 skins,\r\n'b'which he intended to use in this state, without subjecting them to any\r\n'b'tanning process.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers waited till the tide was again low, and crossing the\r\n'b'channel they entered the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The skins had then to be stretched on a frame of wood and sewn by means\r\n'b'of fibers so as to preserve the air without allowing too much to escape.\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had nothing but the two steel blades from Top\xe2\x80\x99s collar,\r\n'b'and yet he was so clever, and his companions aided him with so much\r\n'b'intelligence, that three days afterwards the little colony\xe2\x80\x99s stock of\r\n'b'tools was augmented by a blowing-machine, destined to inject the air\r\n'b'into the midst of the ore when it should be subjected to heat--an\r\n'b'indispensable condition to the success of the operation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the morning of the 20th of April began the \xe2\x80\x9cmetallic period,\xe2\x80\x9d as the\r\n'b'reporter called it in his notes. The engineer had decided, as has been\r\n'b'said, to operate near the veins both of coal and ore. Now, according to\r\n'b'his observations, these veins were situated at the foot of the northeast\r\n'b'spurs of Mount Franklin, that is to say, a distance of six miles from\r\n'b'their home. It was impossible, therefore, to return every day to the\r\n'b'Chimneys, and it was agreed that the little colony should camp under a\r\n'b'hut of branches, so that the important operation could be followed night\r\n'b'and day.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This settled, they set out in the morning. Neb and Pencroft dragged the\r\n'b'bellows on a hurdle; also a quantity of vegetables and animals, which\r\n'b'they besides could renew on the way.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The road led through Jacamar Wood, which they traversed obliquely from\r\n'b'southeast to northwest, and in the thickest part. It was necessary to\r\n'b'beat a path, which would in the future form the most direct road to\r\n'b'Prospect Heights and Mount Franklin. The trees, belonging to the species\r\n'b'already discovered, were magnificent. Herbert found some new ones, among\r\n'b'others some which Pencroft called \xe2\x80\x9csham leeks\xe2\x80\x9d; for, in spite of their\r\n'b'size, they were of the same liliaceous family as the onion, chive,\r\n'b'shallot, or asparagus. These trees produce ligneous roots which, when\r\n'b'cooked, are excellent; from them, by fermentation, a very agreeable\r\n'b'liquor is made. They therefore made a good store of the roots.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The journey through the wood was long; it lasted the whole day, and so\r\n'b'allowed plenty of time for examining the flora and fauna. Top, who\r\n'b'took special charge of the fauna, ran through the grass and brushwood,\r\n'b'putting up all sorts of game. Herbert and Gideon Spilett killed two\r\n'b'kangaroos with bows and arrows, and also an animal which strongly\r\n'b'resembled both a hedgehog and an ant-eater. It was like the first\r\n'b'because it rolled itself into a ball, and bristled with spines, and the\r\n'b'second because it had sharp claws, a long slender snout which terminated\r\n'b'in a bird\xe2\x80\x99s beak, and an extendible tongue, covered with little thorns\r\n'b'which served to hold the insects.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when it is in the pot,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft naturally, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will it be\r\n'b'like?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn excellent piece of beef,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will not ask more from it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this excursion they saw several wild boars, which however, did\r\n'b'not offer to attack the little band, and it appeared as if they would\r\n'b'not meet with any dangerous beasts; when, in a thick part of the wood,\r\n'b'the reporter thought he saw, some paces from him, among the lower\r\n'b'branches of a tree, an animal which he took for a bear, and which he\r\n'b'very tranquilly began to draw. Happily for Gideon Spilett, the animal in\r\n'b'question did not belong to the redoubtable family of the plantigrades.\r\n'b'It was only a koala, better known under the name of the sloth, being\r\n'b'about the size of a large dog, and having stiff hair of a dirty color,\r\n'b'the paws armed with strong claws, which enabled it to climb trees and\r\n'b'feed on the leaves. Having identified the animal, which they did not\r\n'b'disturb, Gideon Spilett erased \xe2\x80\x9cbear\xe2\x80\x9d from the title of his sketch,\r\n'b'putting koala in its place, and the journey was resumed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, Cyrus Harding gave the signal to halt.\r\n'b'They were now outside the forest, at the beginning of the powerful spurs\r\n'b'which supported Mount Franklin towards the west. At a distance of some\r\n'b'hundred feet flowed the Red Creek, and consequently plenty of fresh\r\n'b'water was within their reach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The camp was soon organized. In less than an hour, on the edge of the\r\n'b'forest, among the trees, a hut of branches interlaced with creepers,\r\n'b'and pasted over with clay, offered a tolerable shelter. Their geological\r\n'b'researches were put off till the next day. Supper was prepared, a good\r\n'b'fire blazed before the hut, the roast turned, and at eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\r\n'b'while one of the settlers watched to keep up the fire, in case any wild\r\n'b'beasts should prowl in the neighborhood, the others slept soundly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 21st of April, Cyrus Harding accompanied by Herbert,\r\n'b'went to look for the soil of ancient formation, on which he had already\r\n'b'discovered a specimen of ore. They found the vein above ground, near the\r\n'b'source of the creek, at the foot of one of the northeastern spurs. This\r\n'b'ore, very rich in iron, enclosed in its fusible veinstone, was perfectly\r\n'b'suited to the mode of reduction which the engineer intended to employ;\r\n'b'that is, the Catalan method, but simplified, as it is used in\r\n'b'Corsica. In fact, the Catalan method, properly so called, requires the\r\n'b'construction of kilns and crucibles, in which the ore and the coal,\r\n'b'placed in alternate layers, are transformed and reduced, But Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding intended to economize these constructions, and wished simply to\r\n'b'form, with the ore and the coal, a cubic mass, to the center of which he\r\n'b'would direct the wind from his bellows. Doubtless, it was the proceeding\r\n'b'employed by Tubalcain, and the first metallurgists of the inhabited\r\n'b'world. Now that which had succeeded with the grandson of Adam, and which\r\n'b'still yielded good results in countries rich in ore and fuel, could not\r\n'b'but succeed with the settlers in Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The coal, as well as the ore, was collected without trouble on the\r\n'b'surface of the ground. They first broke the ore into little pieces,\r\n'b'and cleansed them with the hand from the impurities which soiled their\r\n'b'surface. Then coal and ore were arranged in heaps and in successive\r\n'b'layers, as the charcoal-burner does with the wood which he wishes to\r\n'b'carbonize. In this way, under the influence of the air projected by the\r\n'b'blowing-machine, the coal would be transformed into carbonic acid, then\r\n'b'into oxide of carbon, its use being to reduce the oxide of iron, that is\r\n'b'to say, to rid it of the oxygen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus the engineer proceeded. The bellows of sealskin, furnished at its\r\n'b'extremity with a nozzle of clay, which had been previously fabricated\r\n'b'in the pottery kiln, was established near the heap of ore. Using the\r\n'b'mechanism which consisted of a frame, cords of fiber and counterpoise,\r\n'b'he threw into the mass an abundance of air, which by raising the\r\n'b'temperature also concurred with the chemical transformation to produce\r\n'b'in time pure iron.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The operation was difficult. All the patience, all the ingenuity of the\r\n'b'settlers was needed; but at last it succeeded, and the result was a lump\r\n'b'of iron, reduced to a spongy state, which it was necessary to shingle\r\n'b'and fagot, that is to say, to forge so as to expel from it the liquefied\r\n'b'veinstone. These amateur smiths had, of course, no hammer; but they were\r\n'b'in no worse a situation than the first metallurgist, and therefore did\r\n'b'what, no doubt, he had to do.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A handle was fixed to the first lump, and was used as a hammer to forge\r\n'b'the second on a granite anvil, and thus they obtained a coarse but\r\n'b'useful metal. At length, after many trials and much fatigue, on the 25th\r\n'b'of April several bars of iron were forged, and transformed into tools,\r\n'b'crowbars, pincers, pickaxes, spades, etc., which Pencroft and Neb\r\n'b'declared to be real jewels. But the metal was not yet in its most\r\n'b'serviceable state, that is, of steel. Now steel is a combination of iron\r\n'b'and coal, which is extracted, either from the liquid ore, by taking from\r\n'b'it the excess of coal, or from the iron by adding to it the coal which\r\n'b'was wanting. The first, obtained by the decarburation of the metal,\r\n'b'gives natural or puddled steel; the second, produced by the carburation\r\n'b'of the iron, gives steel of cementation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the last which Cyrus Harding intended to forge, as he possessed\r\n'b'iron in a pure state. He succeeded by heating the metal with powdered\r\n'b'coal in a crucible which had previously been manufactured from clay\r\n'b'suitable for the purpose.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He then worked this steel, which is malleable both when hot or cold,\r\n'b'with the hammer. Neb and Pencroft, cleverly directed, made hatchets,\r\n'b'which, heated red-hot, and plunged suddenly into cold water, acquired an\r\n'b'excellent temper.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Other instruments, of course roughly fashioned, were also manufactured;\r\n'b'blades for planes, axes, hatchets, pieces of steel to be transformed\r\n'b'into saws, chisels; then iron for spades, pickaxes, hammers, nails,\r\n'b'etc. At last, on the 5th of May, the metallic period ended, the smiths\r\n'b'returned to the Chimneys, and new work would soon authorize them to take\r\n'b'a fresh title.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 16\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the 6th of May, a day which corresponds to the 6th of November in\r\n'b'the countries of the Northern Hemisphere. The sky had been obscured for\r\n'b'some days, and it was of importance to make preparations for the winter.\r\n'b'However, the temperature was not as yet much lower, and a centigrade\r\n'b'thermometer, transported to Lincoln Island, would still have marked an\r\n'b'average of ten to twelve degrees above zero. This was not surprising,\r\n'b'since Lincoln Island, probably situated between the thirty-fifth and\r\n'b'fortieth parallel, would be subject, in the Southern Hemisphere, to\r\n'b'the same climate as Sicily or Greece in the Northern Hemisphere. But as\r\n'b'Greece and Sicily have severe cold, producing snow and ice, so doubtless\r\n'b'would Lincoln Island in the severest part of the winter and it was\r\n'b'advisable to provide against it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In any case if cold did not yet threaten them, the rainy season would\r\n'b'begin, and on this lonely island, exposed to all the fury of the\r\n'b'elements, in mid-ocean, bad weather would be frequent, and probably\r\n'b'terrible. The question of a more comfortable dwelling than the Chimneys\r\n'b'must therefore be seriously considered and promptly resolved on.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, naturally, had some predilection for the retreat which he\r\n'b'had discovered, but he well understood that another must be found. The\r\n'b'Chimneys had been already visited by the sea, under circumstances\r\n'b'which are known, and it would not do to be exposed again to a similar\r\n'b'accident.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d added Cyrus Harding, who this day was talking of these things\r\n'b'with his companions, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have some precautions to take.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? The island is not inhabited,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is probable,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9calthough we have not yet\r\n'b'explored the interior; but if no human beings are found, I fear that\r\n'b'dangerous animals may abound. It is necessary to guard against a\r\n'b'possible attack, so that we shall not be obliged to watch every night,\r\n'b'or to keep up a fire. And then, my friends, we must foresee everything.\r\n'b'We are here in a part of the Pacific often frequented by Malay\r\n'b'pirates--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cat such a distance from land?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cThese pirates are bold sailors as\r\n'b'well as formidable enemies, and we must take measures accordingly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will fortify ourselves against savages\r\n'b'with two legs as well as against savages with four. But, captain, will\r\n'b'it not be best to explore every part of the island before undertaking\r\n'b'anything else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat would be best,\xe2\x80\x9d added Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows if we might not find on the opposite side one of the caverns\r\n'b'which we have searched for in vain here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you forget, my friends, that\r\n'b'it will be necessary to establish ourselves in the neighborhood of a\r\n'b'watercourse, and that, from the summit of Mount Franklin, we could not\r\n'b'see towards the west, either stream or river. Here, on the contrary, we\r\n'b'are placed between the Mercy and Lake Grant, an advantage which must not\r\n'b'be neglected. And, besides, this side, looking towards the east, is not\r\n'b'exposed as the other is to the trade-winds, which in this hemisphere\r\n'b'blow from the northwest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9clet us build a house on the edge\r\n'b'of the lake. Neither bricks nor tools are wanting now. After having been\r\n'b'brickmakers, potters, smelters, and smiths, we shall surely know how to\r\n'b'be masons!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend; but before coming to any decision we must consider\r\n'b'the matter thoroughly. A natural dwelling would spare us much work,\r\n'b'and would be a surer retreat, for it would be as well defended against\r\n'b'enemies from the interior as those from outside.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we have already\r\n'b'examined all that mass of granite, and there is not a hole, not a\r\n'b'cranny!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, not one!\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cAh, if we were able to dig out a\r\n'b'dwelling in that cliff, at a good height, so as to be out of the reach\r\n'b'of harm, that would be capital! I can see that on the front which looks\r\n'b'seaward, five or six rooms--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith windows to light them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, laughing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd a staircase to climb up to them!\xe2\x80\x9d added Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are laughing,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand why? What is there impossible\r\n'b'in what I propose? Haven\xe2\x80\x99t we got pickaxes and spades? Won\xe2\x80\x99t Captain\r\n'b'Harding be able to make powder to blow up the mine? Isn\xe2\x80\x99t it true,\r\n'b'captain, that you will make powder the very day we want it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding listened to the enthusiastic Pencroft developing his\r\n'b'fanciful projects. To attack this mass of granite, even by a mine, was\r\n'b'Herculean work, and it was really vexing that nature could not help them\r\n'b'at their need. But the engineer did not reply to the sailor except by\r\n'b'proposing to examine the cliff more attentively, from the mouth of the\r\n'b'river to the angle which terminated it on the north.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They went out, therefore, and the exploration was made with extreme\r\n'b'care, over an extent of nearly two miles. But in no place in the bare,\r\n'b'straight cliff, could any cavity be found. The nests of the rock pigeons\r\n'b'which fluttered at its summit were only, in reality, holes bored at the\r\n'b'very top, and on the irregular edge of the granite.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was a provoking circumstance, and as to attacking this cliff, either\r\n'b'with pickaxe or with powder, so as to effect a sufficient excavation, it\r\n'b'was not to be thought of. It so happened that, on all this part of the\r\n'b'shore, Pencroft had discovered the only habitable shelter, that is to\r\n'b'say, the Chimneys, which now had to be abandoned.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The exploration ended, the colonists found themselves at the north angle\r\n'b'of the cliff, where it terminated in long slopes which died away on the\r\n'b'shore. From this place, to its extreme limit in the west, it only formed\r\n'b'a sort of declivity, a thick mass of stones, earth, and sand, bound\r\n'b'together by plants, bushes, and grass inclined at an angle of only\r\n'b'forty-five degrees. Clumps of trees grew on these slopes, which were\r\n'b'also carpeted with thick grass. But the vegetation did not extend\r\n'b'far, and a long, sandy plain, which began at the foot of these slopes,\r\n'b'reached to the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding thought, not without reason, that the overplus of the lake\r\n'b'must overflow on this side. The excess of water furnished by the Red\r\n'b'Creek must also escape by some channel or other. Now the engineer had\r\n'b'not yet found this channel on any part of the shore already explored,\r\n'b'that is to say, from the mouth of the stream on the west of Prospect\r\n'b'Heights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer now proposed to his companions to climb the slope, and to\r\n'b'return to the Chimneys by the heights, while exploring the northern\r\n'b'and eastern shores of the lake. The proposal was accepted, and in a few\r\n'b'minutes Herbert and Neb were on the upper plateau. Cyrus Harding, Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, and Pencroft followed with more sedate steps.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The beautiful sheet of water glittered through the trees under the rays\r\n'b'of the sun. In this direction the country was charming. The eye feasted\r\n'b'on the groups of trees. Some old trunks, bent with age, showed black\r\n'b'against the verdant grass which covered the ground. Crowds of brilliant\r\n'b'cockatoos screamed among the branches, moving prisms, hopping from one\r\n'b'bough to another.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers instead of going directly to the north bank of the lake,\r\n'b'made a circuit round the edge of the plateau, so as to join the mouth\r\n'b'of the creek on its left bank. It was a detour of more than a mile and a\r\n'b'half. Walking was easy, for the trees widely spread, left a considerable\r\n'b'space between them. The fertile zone evidently stopped at this point,\r\n'b'and vegetation would be less vigorous in the part between the course of\r\n'b'the Creek and the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions walked over this new ground with great\r\n'b'care. Bows, arrows, and sticks with sharp iron points were their only\r\n'b'weapons. However, no wild beast showed itself, and it was probable that\r\n'b'these animals frequented rather the thick forests in the south; but the\r\n'b'settlers had the disagreeable surprise of seeing Top stop before a snake\r\n'b'of great size, measuring from fourteen to fifteen feet in length. Neb\r\n'b'killed it by a blow from his stick. Cyrus Harding examined the reptile,\r\n'b'and declared it not venomous, for it belonged to that species of diamond\r\n'b'serpents which the natives of New South Wales rear. But it was possible\r\n'b'that others existed whose bite was mortal such as the deaf vipers with\r\n'b'forked tails, which rise up under the feet, or those winged snakes,\r\n'b'furnished with two ears, which enable them to proceed with great\r\n'b'rapidity. Top, the first moment of surprise over, began a reptile chase\r\n'b'with such eagerness, that they feared for his safety. His master called\r\n'b'him back directly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The mouth of the Red Creek, at the place where it entered into the lake,\r\n'b'was soon reached. The explorers recognized on the opposite shore the\r\n'b'point which they had visited on their descent from Mount Franklin. Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding ascertained that the flow of water into it from the creek was\r\n'b'considerable. Nature must therefore have provided some place for the\r\n'b'escape of the overplus. This doubtless formed a fall, which, if it could\r\n'b'be discovered, would be of great use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists, walking apart, but not straying far from each other,\r\n'b'began to skirt the edge of the lake, which was very steep. The water\r\n'b'appeared to be full of fish, and Pencroft resolved to make some\r\n'b'fishing-rods, so as to try and catch some.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The northeast point was first to be doubled. It might have been supposed\r\n'b'that the discharge of water was at this place, for the extremity of the\r\n'b'lake was almost on a level with the edge of the plateau. But no signs of\r\n'b'this were discovered, and the colonists continued to explore the bank,\r\n'b'which, after a slight bend, descended parallel to the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this side the banks were less woody, but clumps of trees, here and\r\n'b'there, added to the picturesqueness of the country. Lake Grant was\r\n'b'viewed from thence in all its extent, and no breath disturbed the\r\n'b'surface of its waters. Top, in beating the bushes, put up flocks of\r\n'b'birds of different kinds, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert saluted with\r\n'b'arrows. One was hit by the lad, and fell into some marshy grass. Top\r\n'b'rushed forward, and brought a beautiful swimming bird, of a slate color,\r\n'b'short beak, very developed frontal plate, and wings edged with white. It\r\n'b'was a \xe2\x80\x9ccoot,\xe2\x80\x9d the size of a large partridge, belonging to the group of\r\n'b'macrodactyls which form the transition between the order of wading birds\r\n'b'and that of palmipeds. Sorry game, in truth, and its flavor is far from\r\n'b'pleasant. But Top was not so particular in these things as his masters,\r\n'b'and it was agreed that the coot should be for his supper.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers were now following the eastern bank of the lake, and they\r\n'b'would not be long in reaching the part which they already knew.\r\n'b'The engineer was much surprised at not seeing any indication of the\r\n'b'discharge of water. The reporter and the sailor talked with him, and he\r\n'b'could not conceal his astonishment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this moment Top, who had been very quiet till then, gave signs of\r\n'b'agitation. The intelligent animal went backwards and forwards on the\r\n'b'shore, stopped suddenly, and looked at the water, one paw raised, as if\r\n'b'he was pointing at some invisible game; then he barked furiously, and\r\n'b'was suddenly silent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions had at first paid any attention\r\n'b'to Top\xe2\x80\x99s behavior; but the dog\xe2\x80\x99s barking soon became so frequent that\r\n'b'the engineer noticed it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is there, Top?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The dog bounded towards his master, seeming to be very uneasy, and then\r\n'b'rushed again towards the bank. Then, all at once, he plunged into the\r\n'b'lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere, Top!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cyrus Harding, who did not like his dog to venture\r\n'b'into the treacherous water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s happening down there?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft, examining the surface of\r\n'b'the lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop smells some amphibious creature,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn alligator, perhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cAlligators are only met with in\r\n'b'regions less elevated in latitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile Top had returned at his master\xe2\x80\x99s call, and had regained the\r\n'b'shore: but he could not stay quiet; he plunged in among the tall grass,\r\n'b'and guided by instinct, he appeared to follow some invisible being which\r\n'b'was slipping along under the surface of the water. However the water\r\n'b'was calm; not a ripple disturbed its surface. Several times the settlers\r\n'b'stopped on the bank, and observed it attentively. Nothing appeared.\r\n'b'There was some mystery there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer was puzzled.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us pursue this exploration to the end,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Half an hour after they had all arrived at the southeast angle of the\r\n'b'lake, on Prospect Heights. At this point the examination of the banks of\r\n'b'the lake was considered finished, and yet the engineer had not been able\r\n'b'to discover how and where the waters were discharged. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt\r\n'b'this overflow exists,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, \xe2\x80\x9cand since it is not visible it must\r\n'b'go through the granite cliff at the west!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what importance do you attach to knowing that, my dear Cyrus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cConsiderable importance,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cfor if it flows\r\n'b'through the cliff there is probably some cavity, which it would be easy\r\n'b'to render habitable after turning away the water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut is it not possible, captain, that the water flows away at the\r\n'b'bottom of the lake,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand that it reaches the sea by some\r\n'b'subterranean passage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat might be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand should it be so we shall be\r\n'b'obliged to build our house ourselves, since nature has not done it for\r\n'b'us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists were about to begin to traverse the plateau to return to\r\n'b'the Chimneys, when Top gave new signs of agitation. He barked with fury,\r\n'b'and before his master could restrain him, he had plunged a second time\r\n'b'into the lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All ran towards the bank. The dog was already more than twenty feet off,\r\n'b'and Cyrus was calling him back, when an enormous head emerged from the\r\n'b'water, which did not appear to be deep in that place.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert recognized directly the species of amphibian to which the\r\n'b'tapering head, with large eyes, and adorned with long silky mustaches,\r\n'b'belonged.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA lamantin!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was not a lamantin, but one of that species of the order of\r\n'b'cetaceans, which bear the name of the \xe2\x80\x9cdugong,\xe2\x80\x9d for its nostrils were\r\n'b'open at the upper part of its snout. The enormous animal rushed on the\r\n'b'dog, who tried to escape by returning towards the shore. His master\r\n'b'could do nothing to save him, and before Gideon Spilett or Herbert\r\n'b'thought of bending their bows, Top, seized by the dugong, had\r\n'b'disappeared beneath the water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb, his iron-tipped spear in his hand, wished to go to Top\xe2\x80\x99s help, and\r\n'b'attack the dangerous animal in its own element.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, restraining his courageous servant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, a struggle was going on beneath the water, an inexplicable\r\n'b'struggle, for in his situation Top could not possibly resist; and\r\n'b'judging by the bubbling of the surface it must be also a terrible\r\n'b'struggle, and could not but terminate in the death of the dog! But\r\n'b'suddenly, in the middle of a foaming circle, Top reappeared. Thrown in\r\n'b'the air by some unknown power, he rose ten feet above the surface of the\r\n'b'lake, fell again into the midst of the agitated waters, and then soon\r\n'b'gained the shore, without any severe wounds, miraculously saved.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions could not understand it. What was not\r\n'b'less inexplicable was that the struggle still appeared to be going on.\r\n'b'Doubtless, the dugong, attacked by some powerful animal, after having\r\n'b'released the dog, was fighting on its own account. But it did not last\r\n'b'long. The water became red with blood, and the body of the dugong,\r\n'b'emerging from the sheet of scarlet which spread around, soon stranded on\r\n'b'a little beach at the south angle of the lake. The colonists ran towards\r\n'b'it. The dugong was dead. It was an enormous animal, fifteen or sixteen\r\n'b'feet long, and must have weighed from three to four thousand pounds. At\r\n'b'its neck was a wound, which appeared to have been produced by a sharp\r\n'b'blade.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What could the amphibious creature have been, who, by this terrible\r\n'b'blow had destroyed the formidable dugong? No one could tell, and much\r\n'b'interested in this incident, Harding and his companions returned to the\r\n'b'Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 17\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 7th of May, Harding and Gideon Spilett, leaving Neb to\r\n'b'prepare breakfast, climbed Prospect Heights, while Herbert and Pencroft\r\n'b'ascended by the river, to renew their store of wood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer and the reporter soon reached the little beach on which the\r\n'b'dugong had been stranded. Already flocks of birds had attacked the mass\r\n'b'of flesh, and had to be driven away with stones, for Cyrus wished to\r\n'b'keep the fat for the use of the colony. As to the animal\xe2\x80\x99s flesh\r\n'b'it would furnish excellent food, for in the islands of the Malay\r\n'b'Archipelago and elsewhere, it is especially reserved for the table of\r\n'b'the native princes. But that was Neb\xe2\x80\x99s affair.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this moment Cyrus Harding had other thoughts. He was much interested\r\n'b'in the incident of the day before. He wished to penetrate the mystery\r\n'b'of that submarine combat, and to ascertain what monster could have given\r\n'b'the dugong so strange a wound. He remained at the edge of the lake,\r\n'b'looking, observing; but nothing appeared under the tranquil waters,\r\n'b'which sparkled in the first rays of the rising sun.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At the beach, on which lay the body of the dugong, the water was\r\n'b'tolerably shallow, but from this point the bottom of the lake sloped\r\n'b'gradually, and it was probable that the depth was considerable in the\r\n'b'center. The lake might be considered as a large center basin, which was\r\n'b'filled by the water from the Red Creek.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cthere seems to be nothing suspicious\r\n'b'in this water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand I really do not know\r\n'b'how to account for the incident of yesterday.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI acknowledge,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the wound given this creature\r\n'b'is, at least, very strange, and I cannot explain either how Top was\r\n'b'so vigorously cast up out of the water. One could have thought that a\r\n'b'powerful arm hurled him up, and that the same arm with a dagger killed\r\n'b'the dugong!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, who had become thoughtful; \xe2\x80\x9cthere is\r\n'b'something there that I cannot understand. But do you better understand\r\n'b'either, my dear Spilett, in what way I was saved myself--how I was drawn\r\n'b'from the waves, and carried to the downs? No! Is it not true? Now, I\r\n'b'feel sure that there is some mystery there, which, doubtless, we shall\r\n'b'discover some day. Let us observe, but do not dwell on these singular\r\n'b'incidents before our companions. Let us keep our remarks to ourselves,\r\n'b'and continue our work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It will be remembered that the engineer had not as yet been able to\r\n'b'discover the place where the surplus water escaped, but he knew it must\r\n'b'exist somewhere. He was much surprised to see a strong current at this\r\n'b'place. By throwing in some bits of wood he found that it set towards the\r\n'b'southern angle. He followed the current, and arrived at the south point\r\n'b'of the lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was there a sort of depression in the water, as if it was suddenly\r\n'b'lost in some fissure in the ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding listened; placing his ear to the level of the lake, he very\r\n'b'distinctly heard the noise of a subterranean fall.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cis the discharge of the water; there,\r\n'b'doubtless, by a passage in the granite cliff, it joins the sea, through\r\n'b'cavities which we can use to our profit. Well, I can find it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer cut a long branch, stripped it of its leaves, and plunging\r\n'b'it into the angle between the two banks, he found that there was a large\r\n'b'hole one foot only beneath the surface of the water. This hole was the\r\n'b'opening so long looked for in vain, and the force of the current was\r\n'b'such that the branch was torn from the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s hands and disappeared.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no doubt about it now,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cThere is the\r\n'b'outlet, and I will lay it open to view!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy lowering the level of the water of the lake three feet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how will you lower the level?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy opening another outlet larger than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt what place, Cyrus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt the part of the bank nearest the coast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is a mass of granite!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cI will blow up the granite, and the\r\n'b'water escaping, will subside, so as to lay bare this opening--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd make a waterfall, by falling on to the beach,\xe2\x80\x9d added the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA fall that we shall make use of!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer hurried away his companion, whose confidence in Harding was\r\n'b'such that he did not doubt the enterprise would succeed. And yet, how\r\n'b'was this granite wall to be opened without powder, and with imperfect\r\n'b'instruments? Was not this work upon which the engineer was so bent above\r\n'b'their strength?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When Harding and the reporter entered the Chimneys, they found Herbert\r\n'b'and Pencroft unloading their raft of wood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe woodmen have just finished, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, laughing,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cand when you want masons--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMasons,--no, but chemists,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d added the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are going to blow up the island--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBlow up the island?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPart of it, at least,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cListen to me, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer. And he made known to them\r\n'b'the result of his observations.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'According to him, a cavity, more or less considerable, must exist in\r\n'b'the mass of granite which supported Prospect Heights, and he intended\r\n'b'to penetrate into it. To do this, the opening through which the water\r\n'b'rushed must first be cleared, and the level lowered by making a larger\r\n'b'outlet. Therefore an explosive substance must be manufactured, which\r\n'b'would make a deep trench in some other part of the shore. This was what\r\n'b'Harding was going to attempt with the minerals which nature placed at\r\n'b'his disposal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is useless to say with what enthusiasm all, especially Pencroft,\r\n'b'received this project. To employ great means, open the granite, create a\r\n'b'cascade, that suited the sailor. And he would just as soon be a chemist\r\n'b'as a mason or bootmaker, since the engineer wanted chemicals. He would\r\n'b'be all that they liked, \xe2\x80\x9ceven a professor of dancing and deportment,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' said he to Neb, if that was ever necessary.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb and Pencroft were first of all told to extract the grease from the\r\n'b'dugong, and to keep the flesh, which was destined for food. Such perfect\r\n'b'confidence had they in the engineer, that they set out directly,\r\n'b'without even asking a question. A few minutes after them, Cyrus Harding,\r\n'b'Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, dragging the hurdle, went towards the vein\r\n'b'of coals, where those shistose pyrites abound which are met with in the\r\n'b'most recent transition soil, and of which Harding had already found a\r\n'b'specimen. All the day being employed in carrying a quantity of these\r\n'b'stones to the Chimneys, by evening they had several tons.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 8th of May, the engineer began his manipulations.\r\n'b'These shistose pyrites being composed principally of coal, flint,\r\n'b'alumina, and sulphuret of iron--the latter in excess--it was necessary\r\n'b'to separate the sulphuret of iron, and transform it into sulphate as\r\n'b'rapidly as possible. The sulphate obtained, the sulphuric acid could\r\n'b'then be extracted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was the object to be attained. Sulphuric acid is one of the agents\r\n'b'the most frequently employed, and the manufacturing importance of a\r\n'b'nation can be measured by the consumption which is made of it. This acid\r\n'b'would later be of great use to the settlers, in the manufacturing of\r\n'b'candles, tanning skins, etc., but this time the engineer reserved it for\r\n'b'another use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding chose, behind the Chimneys, a site where the ground\r\n'b'was perfectly level. On this ground he placed a layer of branches and\r\n'b'chopped wood, on which were piled some pieces of shistose pyrites,\r\n'b'buttressed one against the other, the whole being covered with a thin\r\n'b'layer of pyrites, previously reduced to the size of a nut.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This done, they set fire to the wood, the heat was communicated to the\r\n'b'shist, which soon kindled, since it contains coal and sulphur. Then new\r\n'b'layers of bruised pyrites were arranged so as to form an immense\r\n'b'heap, the exterior of which was covered with earth and grass, several\r\n'b'air-holes being left, as if it was a stack of wood which was to be\r\n'b'carbonized to make charcoal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They then left the transformation to complete itself, and it would\r\n'b'not take less than ten or twelve days for the sulphuret of iron to be\r\n'b'changed to sulphate of iron and the alumina into sulphate of alumina,\r\n'b'two equally soluble substances, the others, flint, burnt coal, and\r\n'b'cinders, not being so.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While this chemical work was going on, Cyrus Harding proceeded with\r\n'b'other operations, which were pursued with more than zeal,--it was\r\n'b'eagerness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb and Pencroft had taken away the fat from the dugong, and placed it\r\n'b'in large earthen pots. It was then necessary to separate the glycerine\r\n'b'from the fat by saponifying it. Now, to obtain this result, it had to\r\n'b'be treated either with soda or lime. In fact, one or other of these\r\n'b'substances, after having attacked the fat, would form a soap by\r\n'b'separating the glycerine, and it was just this glycerine which the\r\n'b'engineer wished to obtain. There was no want of lime, only treatment by\r\n'b'lime would give calcareous soap, insoluble, and consequently useless,\r\n'b'while treatment by soda would furnish, on the contrary, a soluble soap,\r\n'b'which could be put to domestic use. Now, a practical man, like Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding, would rather try to obtain soda. Was this difficult? No; for\r\n'b'marine plants abounded on the shore, glass-wort, ficoides, and all\r\n'b'those fucaceae which form wrack. A large quantity of these plants\r\n'b'was collected, first dried, then burnt in holes in the open air. The\r\n'b'combustion of these plants was kept up for several days, and the result\r\n'b'was a compact gray mass, which has been long known under the name of\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cnatural soda.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This obtained, the engineer treated the fat with soda, which gave both a\r\n'b'soluble soap and that neutral substance, glycerine.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But this was not all. Cyrus Harding still needed, in view of his future\r\n'b'preparation, another substance, nitrate of potash, which is better known\r\n'b'under the name of salt niter, or of saltpeter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding could have manufactured this substance by treating the\r\n'b'carbonate of potash, which would be easily extracted from the cinders of\r\n'b'the vegetables, by azotic acid. But this acid was wanting, and he would\r\n'b'have been in some difficulty, if nature had not happily furnished the\r\n'b'saltpeter, without giving them any other trouble than that of picking it\r\n'b'up. Herbert found a vein of it at the foot of Mount Franklin, and they\r\n'b'had nothing to do but purify this salt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These different works lasted a week. They were finished before\r\n'b'the transformation of the sulphuret into sulphate of iron had been\r\n'b'accomplished. During the following days the settlers had time to\r\n'b'construct a furnace of bricks of a particular arrangement, to serve for\r\n'b'the distillation of the sulphate or iron when it had been obtained. All\r\n'b'this was finished about the 18th of May, nearly at the time when the\r\n'b'chemical transformation terminated. Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and\r\n'b'Pencroft, skillfully directed by the engineer, had become most clever\r\n'b'workmen. Before all masters, necessity is the one most listened to, and\r\n'b'who teaches the best.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When the heap of pyrites had been entirely reduced by fire, the result\r\n'b'of the operation, consisting of sulphate of iron, sulphate of alumina,\r\n'b'flint, remains of coal, and cinders was placed in a basinful of water.\r\n'b'They stirred this mixture, let it settle, then decanted it, and obtained\r\n'b'a clear liquid containing in solution sulphate of iron and sulphate of\r\n'b'alumina, the other matters remaining solid, since they are insoluble.\r\n'b'Lastly, this liquid being partly evaporated, crystals of sulphate of\r\n'b'iron were deposited, and the not evaporated liquid, which contained the\r\n'b'sulphate of alumina, was thrown away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had now at his disposal a large quantity of these sulphate\r\n'b'of iron crystals, from which the sulphuric acid had to be extracted. The\r\n'b'making of sulphuric acid is a very expensive manufacture. Considerable\r\n'b'works are necessary--a special set of tools, an apparatus of\r\n'b'platina, leaden chambers, unassailable by the acid, and in which the\r\n'b'transformation is performed, etc. The engineer had none of these at his\r\n'b'disposal, but he knew that, in Bohemia especially, sulphuric acid is\r\n'b'manufactured by very simple means, which have also the advantage of\r\n'b'producing it to a superior degree of concentration. It is thus that the\r\n'b'acid known under the name of Nordhausen acid is made.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To obtain sulphuric acid, Cyrus Harding had only one operation to make,\r\n'b'to calcine the sulphate of iron crystals in a closed vase, so that the\r\n'b'sulphuric acid should distil in vapor, which vapor, by condensation,\r\n'b'would produce the acid.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The crystals were placed in pots, and the heat from the furnace would\r\n'b'distil the sulphuric acid. The operation was successfully completed, and\r\n'b'on the 20th of May, twelve days after commencing it, the engineer\r\n'b'was the possessor of the agent which later he hoped to use in so many\r\n'b'different ways.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now, why did he wish for this agent? Simply to produce azotic acid;\r\n'b'and that was easy, since saltpeter, attacked by sulphuric acid, gives\r\n'b'azotic, or nitric, acid by distillation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But, after all, how was he going to employ this azotic acid? His\r\n'b'companions were still ignorant of this, for he had not informed them of\r\n'b'the result at which he aimed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the engineer had nearly accomplished his purpose, and by a\r\n'b'last operation he would procure the substance which had given so much\r\n'b'trouble.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Taking some azotic acid, he mixed it with glycerine, which had been\r\n'b'previously concentrated by evaporation, subjected to the water-bath, and\r\n'b'he obtained, without even employing a refrigerant mixture, several pints\r\n'b'of an oily yellow mixture.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This last operation Cyrus Harding had made alone, in a retired place, at\r\n'b'a distance from the Chimneys, for he feared the danger of an explosion,\r\n'b'and when he showed a bottle of this liquid to his friends, he contented\r\n'b'himself with saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere is nitro-glycerine!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was really this terrible production, of which the explosive power is\r\n'b'perhaps tenfold that of ordinary powder, and which has already caused so\r\n'b'many accidents. However, since a way has been found to transform it into\r\n'b'dynamite, that is to say, to mix with it some solid substance, clay or\r\n'b'sugar, porous enough to hold it, the dangerous liquid has been used\r\n'b'with some security. But dynamite was not yet known at the time when the\r\n'b'settlers worked on Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd is it that liquid that is going to blow up our rocks?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\n'b'Pencroft incredulously.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand this nitro-glycerine will\r\n'b'produce so much the more effect, as the granite is extremely hard, and\r\n'b'will oppose a greater resistance to the explosion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when shall we see this, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, as soon as we have dug a hole for the mine, replied the\r\n'b'engineer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 21st of May, at daybreak, the miners went to the point\r\n'b'which formed the eastern shore of Lake Grant, and was only five hundred\r\n'b'feet from the coast. At this place, the plateau inclined downwards from\r\n'b'the waters, which were only restrained by their granite case. Therefore,\r\n'b'if this case was broken, the water would escape by the opening and form\r\n'b'a stream, which, flowing over the inclined surface of the plateau,\r\n'b'would rush on to the beach. Consequently, the level of the lake would\r\n'b'be greatly lowered, and the opening where the water escaped would be\r\n'b'exposed, which was their final aim.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Under the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s directions, Pencroft, armed with a pickaxe, which\r\n'b'he handled skillfully and vigorously, attacked the granite. The hole was\r\n'b'made on the point of the shore, slanting, so that it should meet a\r\n'b'much lower level than that of the water of the lake. In this way the\r\n'b'explosive force, by scattering the rock, would open a large place for\r\n'b'the water to rush out.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The work took some time, for the engineer, wishing to produce a great\r\n'b'effect, intended to devote not less than seven quarts of nitro-glycerine\r\n'b'to the operation. But Pencroft, relieved by Neb, did so well, that\r\n'b'towards four o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, the mine was finished.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now the question of setting fire to the explosive substance was raised.\r\n'b'Generally, nitro-glycerine is ignited by caps of fulminate, which in\r\n'b'bursting cause the explosion. A shock is therefore needed to produce\r\n'b'the explosion, for, simply lighted, this substance would burn without\r\n'b'exploding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding could certainly have fabricated a percussion cap. In\r\n'b'default of fulminate, he could easily obtain a substance similar to\r\n'b'guncotton, since he had azotic acid at his disposal. This substance,\r\n'b'pressed in a cartridge, and introduced among the nitro-glycerine, would\r\n'b'burst by means of a fuse, and cause the explosion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But Cyrus Harding knew that nitro-glycerine would explode by a shock.\r\n'b'He resolved to employ this means, and try another way, if this did not\r\n'b'succeed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, the blow of a hammer on a few drops of nitro-glycerine, spread\r\n'b'out on a hard surface, was enough to create an explosion. But the\r\n'b'operator could not be there to give the blow, without becoming a victim\r\n'b'to the operation. Harding, therefore, thought of suspending a mass of\r\n'b'iron, weighing several pounds, by means of a fiber, to an upright just\r\n'b'above the mine. Another long fiber, previously impregnated with sulphur,\r\n'b'was attached to the middle of the first, by one end, while the other lay\r\n'b'on the ground several feet distant from the mine. The second fiber being\r\n'b'set on fire, it would burn till it reached the first. This catching\r\n'b'fire in its turn, would break, and the mass of iron would fall on the\r\n'b'nitro-glycerine. This apparatus being then arranged, the engineer, after\r\n'b'having sent his companions to a distance, filled the hole, so that the\r\n'b'nitro-glycerine was on a level with the opening; then he threw a few\r\n'b'drops of it on the surface of the rock, above which the mass of iron was\r\n'b'already suspended.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This done, Harding lit the end of the sulphured fiber, and leaving the\r\n'b'place, he returned with his companions to the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The fiber was intended to burn five and twenty minutes, and, in fact,\r\n'b'five and twenty minutes afterwards a most tremendous explosion was\r\n'b'heard. The island appeared to tremble to its very foundation. Stones\r\n'b'were projected in the air as if by the eruption of a volcano. The shock\r\n'b'produced by the displacing of the air was such, that the rocks of the\r\n'b'Chimneys shook. The settlers, although they were more than two miles\r\n'b'from the mine, were thrown on the ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They rose, climbed the plateau, and ran towards the place where the bank\r\n'b'of the lake must have been shattered by the explosion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A cheer escaped them! A large rent was seen in the granite! A rapid\r\n'b'stream of water rushed foaming across the plateau and dashed down a\r\n'b'height of three hundred feet on to the beach!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 18\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s project had succeeded, but, according to his usual\r\n'b'habit he showed no satisfaction; with closed lips and a fixed look, he\r\n'b'remained motionless. Herbert was in ecstasies, Neb bounded with joy,\r\n'b'Pencroft nodded his great head, murmuring these words,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome, our engineer gets on capitally!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The nitro-glycerine had indeed acted powerfully. The opening which it\r\n'b'had made was so large that the volume of water which escaped through\r\n'b'this new outlet was at least treble that which before passed through the\r\n'b'old one. The result was, that a short time after the operation the level\r\n'b'of the lake would be lowered two feet, or more.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers went to the Chimneys to take some pickaxes, iron-tipped\r\n'b'spears, string made of fibers, flint and steel; they then returned to\r\n'b'the plateau, Top accompanying them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the way the sailor could not help saying to the engineer,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you think, captain, that by means of that charming liquid you\r\n'b'have made, one could blow up the whole of our island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWithout any doubt, the island, continents, and the world itself,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' replied the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is only a question of quantity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen could you not use this nitro-glycerine for loading firearms?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft; for it is too explosive a substance. But it would be easy\r\n'b'to make some guncotton, or even ordinary powder, as we have azotic acid,\r\n'b'saltpeter, sulphur, and coal. Unhappily, it is the guns which we have\r\n'b'not got.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a little determination--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft had erased the word \xe2\x80\x9cimpossible\xe2\x80\x9d from the dictionary of Lincoln\r\n'b'Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers, having arrived at Prospect Heights, went immediately\r\n'b'towards that point of the lake near which was the old opening now\r\n'b'uncovered. This outlet had now become practicable, since the water no\r\n'b'longer rushed through it, and it would doubtless be easy to explore the\r\n'b'interior.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few minutes the settlers had reached the lower point of the lake,\r\n'b'and a glance showed them that the object had been attained.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, in the side of the lake, and now above the surface of the\r\n'b'water, appeared the long-looked-for opening. A narrow ridge, left bare\r\n'b'by the retreat of the water, allowed them to approach it. This orifice\r\n'b'was nearly twenty feet in width, but scarcely two in height. It was like\r\n'b'the mouth of a drain at the edge of the pavement, and therefore did\r\n'b'not offer an easy passage to the settlers; but Neb and Pencroft, taking\r\n'b'their pickaxes, soon made it of a suitable height.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer then approached, and found that the sides of the opening,\r\n'b'in its upper part at least, had not a slope of more than from thirty to\r\n'b'thirty-five degrees. It was therefore practicable, and, provided that\r\n'b'the declivity did not increase, it would be easy to descend even to the\r\n'b'level of the sea. If then, as was probable, some vast cavity existed in\r\n'b'the interior of the granite, it might, perhaps, be of great use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, captain, what are we stopping for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor, impatient\r\n'b'to enter the narrow passage. \xe2\x80\x9cYou see Top has got before us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut we must see our way. Neb, go and\r\n'b'cut some resinous branches.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb and Herbert ran to the edge of the lake, shaded with pines and other\r\n'b'green trees, and soon returned with some branches, which they made\r\n'b'into torches. The torches were lighted with flint and steel, and Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding leading, the settlers ventured into the dark passage, which the\r\n'b'overplus of the lake had formerly filled.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Contrary to what might have been supposed, the diameter of the passage\r\n'b'increased as the explorers proceeded, so that they very soon were able\r\n'b'to stand upright. The granite, worn by the water for an infinite time,\r\n'b'was very slippery, and falls were to be dreaded. But the settlers were\r\n'b'all attached to each other by a cord, as is frequently done in ascending\r\n'b'mountains. Happily some projections of the granite, forming regular\r\n'b'steps, made the descent less perilous. Drops, still hanging from the\r\n'b'rocks, shone here and there under the light of the torches, and\r\n'b'the explorers guessed that the sides were clothed with innumerable\r\n'b'stalactites. The engineer examined this black granite. There was not a\r\n'b'stratum, not a break in it. The mass was compact, and of an extremely\r\n'b'close grain. The passage dated, then, from the very origin of the\r\n'b'island. It was not the water which little by little had hollowed it.\r\n'b'Pluto and not Neptune had bored it with his own hand, and on the wall\r\n'b'traces of an eruptive work could be distinguished, which all the washing\r\n'b'of the water had not been able totally to efface.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers descended very slowly. They could not but feel a certain\r\n'b'awe, in this venturing into these unknown depths, for the first time\r\n'b'visited by human beings. They did not speak, but they thought; and\r\n'b'the thought came to more than one, that some polypus or other\r\n'b'gigantic cephalopod might inhabit the interior cavities, which were in\r\n'b'communication with the sea. However, Top kept at the head of the little\r\n'b'band, and they could rely on the sagacity of the dog, who would not fail\r\n'b'to give the alarm if there was any need for it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After having descended about a hundred feet, following a winding road,\r\n'b'Harding who was walking on before, stopped, and his companions came up\r\n'b'with him. The place where they had halted was wider, so as to form a\r\n'b'cavern of moderate dimensions. Drops of water fell from the vault, but\r\n'b'that did not prove that they oozed through the rock. They were simply\r\n'b'the last traces left by the torrent which had so long thundered through\r\n'b'this cavity, and the air there was pure though slightly damp, but\r\n'b'producing no mephitic exhalation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my dear Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9chere is a very secure\r\n'b'retreat, well hid in the depths of the rock, but it is, however,\r\n'b'uninhabitable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy uninhabitable?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause it is too small and too dark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCouldn\xe2\x80\x99t we enlarge it, hollow it out, make openings to let in light\r\n'b'and air?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, who now thought nothing impossible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on with our exploration,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps lower\r\n'b'down, nature will have spared us this labor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have only gone a third of the way,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNearly a third,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we have descended a hundred feet\r\n'b'from the opening, and it is not impossible that a hundred feet farther\r\n'b'down--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is Top?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb, interrupting his master.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They searched the cavern, but the dog was not there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMost likely he has gone on,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us join him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The descent was continued. The engineer carefully observed all the\r\n'b'deviations of the passage, and notwithstanding so many detours, he\r\n'b'could easily have given an account of its general direction, which went\r\n'b'towards the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers had gone some fifty feet farther, when their attention was\r\n'b'attracted by distant sounds which came up from the depths. They stopped\r\n'b'and listened. These sounds, carried through the passage as through an\r\n'b'acoustic tube, came clearly to the ear.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is Top barking!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand our brave dog is barking furiously!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have our iron-tipped spears,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cKeep on your\r\n'b'guard, and forward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is becoming more and more interesting,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Gideon Spilett in\r\n'b'the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s ear, who nodded. Harding and his companions rushed to the\r\n'b'help of their dog. Top\xe2\x80\x99s barking became more and more perceptible,\r\n'b'and it seemed strangely fierce. Was he engaged in a struggle with some\r\n'b'animal whose retreat he had disturbed? Without thinking of the danger\r\n'b'to which they might be exposed, the explorers were now impelled by an\r\n'b'irresistible curiosity, and in a few minutes, sixteen feet lower they\r\n'b'rejoined Top.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There the passage ended in a vast and magnificent cavern.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top was running backwards and forwards, barking furiously. Pencroft and\r\n'b'Neb, waving their torches, threw the light into every crevice; and\r\n'b'at the same time, Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, their spears\r\n'b'raised, were ready for any emergency which might arise. The enormous\r\n'b'cavern was empty. The settlers explored it in every direction. There was\r\n'b'nothing there, not an animal, not a human being; and yet Top continued\r\n'b'to bark. Neither caresses nor threats could make him be silent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere must be a place somewhere, by which the waters of the lake\r\n'b'reached the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand we must take care not to tumble into\r\n'b'a hole.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Top, go!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The dog, excited by his master\xe2\x80\x99s words, ran towards the extremity of the\r\n'b'cavern, and there redoubled his barking.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They followed him, and by the light of the torches, perceived the mouth\r\n'b'of a regular well in the granite. It was by this that the water escaped;\r\n'b'and this time it was not an oblique and practicable passage, but a\r\n'b'perpendicular well, into which it was impossible to venture.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The torches were held over the opening: nothing could be seen. Harding\r\n'b'took a lighted branch, and threw it into the abyss. The blazing resin,\r\n'b'whose illuminating power increased still more by the rapidity of its\r\n'b'fall, lighted up the interior of the well, but yet nothing appeared. The\r\n'b'flame then went out with a slight hiss, which showed that it had reached\r\n'b'the water, that is to say, the level of the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer, calculating the time employed in its fall, was able to\r\n'b'calculate the depth of the well, which was found to be about ninety\r\n'b'feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The floor of the cavern must thus be situated ninety feet above the\r\n'b'level of the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere is our dwelling,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut it was occupied by some creature,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, whose\r\n'b'curiosity was not yet satisfied.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the creature, amphibious or otherwise, has made off through this\r\n'b'opening,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand has left the place for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d added the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI should like very much to be Top just\r\n'b'for a quarter of an hour, for he doesn\xe2\x80\x99t bark for nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding looked at his dog, and those of his companions who were\r\n'b'near him might have heard him murmur these words,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, I believe that Top knows more than we do about a great many\r\n'b'things.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the wishes of the settlers were for the most part satisfied.\r\n'b'Chance, aided by the marvelous sagacity of their leader, had done them\r\n'b'great service. They had now at their disposal a vast cavern, the size\r\n'b'of which could not be properly calculated by the feeble light of their\r\n'b'torches, but it would certainly be easy to divide it into rooms, by\r\n'b'means of brick partitions, or to use it, if not as a house, at least as\r\n'b'a spacious apartment. The water which had left it could not return. The\r\n'b'place was free.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two difficulties remained; firstly, the possibility of lighting this\r\n'b'excavation in the midst of solid rock; secondly, the necessity of\r\n'b'rendering the means of access more easy. It was useless to think of\r\n'b'lighting it from above, because of the enormous thickness of the granite\r\n'b'which composed the ceiling; but perhaps the outer wall next the sea\r\n'b'might be pierced. Cyrus Harding, during the descent, had roughly\r\n'b'calculated its obliqueness, and consequently the length of the passage,\r\n'b'and was therefore led to believe that the outer wall could not be very\r\n'b'thick. If light was thus obtained, so would a means of access, for\r\n'b'it would be as easy to pierce a door as windows, and to establish an\r\n'b'exterior ladder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding made known his ideas to his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, captain, let us set to work!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cI have my\r\n'b'pickaxe, and I shall soon make my way through this wall. Where shall I\r\n'b'strike?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, showing the sturdy sailor a considerable\r\n'b'recess in the side, which would much diminish the thickness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft attacked the granite, and for half an hour, by the light of the\r\n'b'torches, he made the splinters fly around him. Neb relieved him, then\r\n'b'Spilett took Neb\xe2\x80\x99s place.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This work had lasted two hours, and they began to fear that at this spot\r\n'b'the wall would not yield to the pickaxe, when at a last blow given by\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett, the instrument, passing through the rock, fell outside.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah! hurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The wall only measured there three feet in thickness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding applied his eye to the aperture, which overlooked the ground\r\n'b'from a height of eighty feet. Before him was extended the sea-coast, the\r\n'b'islet, and beyond the open sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Floods of light entered by this hole, inundating the splendid cavern and\r\n'b'producing a magic effect! On its left side it did not measure more than\r\n'b'thirty feet in height and breadth, but on the right it was enormous, and\r\n'b'its vaulted roof rose to a height of more than eighty feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In some places granite pillars, irregularly disposed, supported the\r\n'b'vaulted roof, as those in the nave of a cathedral, here forming lateral\r\n'b'piers, there elliptical arches, adorned with pointed moldings, losing\r\n'b'themselves in dark bays, amid the fantastic arches of which glimpses\r\n'b'could be caught in the shade, covered with a profusion of projections\r\n'b'formed like so many pendants. This cavern was a picturesque mixture of\r\n'b'all the styles of Byzantine, Roman, or Gothic architecture ever produced\r\n'b'by the hand of man. And yet this was only the work of nature. She alone\r\n'b'had hollowed this fairy Alhambra in a mass of granite.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers were overwhelmed with admiration. Where they had only\r\n'b'expected to find a narrow cavity, they had found a sort of marvelous\r\n'b'palace, and Neb had taken off his hat, as if he had been transported\r\n'b'into a temple!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cries of admiration issued from every mouth. Hurrahs resounded, and the\r\n'b'echo was repeated again and again till it died away in the dark naves.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh, my friends!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we have lighted the\r\n'b'interior of this place, and have arranged our rooms and storehouses in\r\n'b'the left part, we shall still have this splendid cavern, which we will\r\n'b'make our study and our museum!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we will call it?--\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGranite House,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding; a name which his companions again\r\n'b'saluted with a cheer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The torches were now almost consumed, and as they were obliged to return\r\n'b'by the passage to reach the summit of the plateau, it was decided to put\r\n'b'off the work necessary for the arrangement of their new dwelling till\r\n'b'the next day.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Before departing, Cyrus Harding leaned once more over the dark well,\r\n'b'which descended perpendicularly to the level of the sea. He listened\r\n'b'attentively. No noise was heard, not even that of the water, which the\r\n'b'undulations of the surge must sometimes agitate in its depths. A flaming\r\n'b'branch was again thrown in. The sides of the well were lighted up for an\r\n'b'instant, but as at the first time, nothing suspicious was seen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'If some marine monster had been surprised unawares by the retreat of the\r\n'b'water, he would by this time have regained the sea by the subterranean\r\n'b'passage, before the new opening had been offered to him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, the engineer was standing motionless, his eyes fixed on the\r\n'b'gulf, without uttering a word.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor approached him, and touching his arm, \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer, as if he had returned\r\n'b'from the land of dreams.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe torches will soon go out.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The little band left the cavern and began to ascend through the dark\r\n'b'passage. Top closed the rear, still growling every now and then. The\r\n'b'ascent was painful enough. The settlers rested a few minutes in the\r\n'b'upper grotto, which made a sort of landing-place halfway up the long\r\n'b'granite staircase. Then they began to climb again.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Soon fresher air was felt. The drops of water, dried by evaporation, no\r\n'b'longer sparkled on the walls. The flaring torches began to grow dim. The\r\n'b'one which Neb carried went out, and if they did not wish to find their\r\n'b'way in the dark, they must hasten.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was done, and a little before four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, at the moment when the\r\n'b'sailor\xe2\x80\x99s torch went out in its turn, Cyrus Harding and his companions\r\n'b'passed out of the passage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 19\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 22nd of May, the arrangement of their new dwelling\r\n'b'was commenced. In fact, the settlers longed to exchange the insufficient\r\n'b'shelter of the Chimneys for this large and healthy retreat, in the midst\r\n'b'of solid rock, and sheltered from the water both of the sea and sky.\r\n'b'Their former dwelling was not, however, to be entirely abandoned, for\r\n'b'the engineer intended to make a manufactory of it for important works.\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s first care was to find out the position of the front of\r\n'b'Granite House from the outside. He went to the beach, and as the\r\n'b'pickaxe when it escaped from the hands of the reporter must have fallen\r\n'b'perpendicularly to the foot of the cliff, the finding it would be\r\n'b'sufficient to show the place where the hole had been pierced in the\r\n'b'granite.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The pickaxe was easily found, and the hole could be seen in a\r\n'b'perpendicular line above the spot where it was stuck in the sand. Some\r\n'b'rock pigeons were already flying in and out of the narrow opening; they\r\n'b'evidently thought that Granite House had been discovered on purpose for\r\n'b'them. It was the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s intention to divide the right portion of the\r\n'b'cavern into several rooms, preceded by an entrance passage, and to light\r\n'b'it by means of five windows and a door, pierced in the front. Pencroft\r\n'b'was much pleased with the five windows, but he could not understand the\r\n'b'use of the door, since the passage offered a natural staircase, through\r\n'b'which it would always be easy to enter Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cif it is easy for us to reach our\r\n'b'dwelling by this passage, it will be equally easy for others besides\r\n'b'us. I mean, on the contrary, to block up that opening, to seal it\r\n'b'hermetically, and, if it is necessary, to completely hide the entrance\r\n'b'by making a dam, and thus causing the water of the lake to rise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how shall we get in?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy an outside ladder,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9ca rope ladder, which,\r\n'b'once drawn up, will render access to our dwelling impossible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut why so many precautions?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cAs yet we have seen no\r\n'b'dangerous animals. As to our island being inhabited by natives, I don\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n'b'believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure of that, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer, looking at\r\n'b'the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course we shall not be quite sure, till we have explored it in every\r\n'b'direction,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cfor we know only a small portion of it as yet. But\r\n'b'at any rate, if we have no enemies in the interior, they may come from\r\n'b'the exterior, for parts of the Pacific are very dangerous. We must be\r\n'b'provided against every contingency.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding spoke wisely; and without making any further objection,\r\n'b'Pencroft prepared to execute his orders.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The front of Granite House was then to be lighted by five windows and a\r\n'b'door, besides a large bay window and some smaller oval ones, which would\r\n'b'admit plenty of light to enter into the marvelous nave which was to be\r\n'b'their chief room. This facade, situated at a height of eighty feet above\r\n'b'the ground, was exposed to the east, and the rising sun saluted it with\r\n'b'its first rays. It was found to be just at that part of the cliff which\r\n'b'was between the projection at the mouth of the Mercy and a perpendicular\r\n'b'line traced above the heap of rocks which formed the Chimneys. Thus\r\n'b'the winds from the northeast would only strike it obliquely, for it was\r\n'b'protected by the projection. Besides, until the window-frames were made,\r\n'b'the engineer meant to close the openings with thick shutters, which\r\n'b'would prevent either wind or rain from entering, and which could be\r\n'b'concealed in need.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first work was to make the openings. This would have taken too long\r\n'b'with the pickaxe alone, and it is known that Harding was an ingenious\r\n'b'man. He had still a quantity of nitro-glycerine at his disposal, and he\r\n'b'employed it usefully. By means of this explosive substance the rock was\r\n'b'broken open at the very places chosen by the engineer. Then, with the\r\n'b'pickaxe and spade, the windows and doors were properly shaped, the\r\n'b'jagged edges were smoothed off, and a few days after the beginning of\r\n'b'the work, Granite House was abundantly lighted by the rising sun,\r\n'b'whose rays penetrated into its most secret recesses. Following the\r\n'b'plan proposed by Cyrus Harding, the space was to be divided into five\r\n'b'compartments looking out on the sea; to the right, an entry with a\r\n'b'door, which would meet the ladder; then a kitchen, thirty feet long; a\r\n'b'dining-room, measuring forty feet; a sleeping-room, of equal size; and\r\n'b'lastly, a \xe2\x80\x9cVisitor\xe2\x80\x99s room,\xe2\x80\x9d petitioned for by Pencroft, and which was\r\n'b'next to the great hall. These rooms, or rather this suite of rooms,\r\n'b'would not occupy all the depth of the cave. There would be also a\r\n'b'corridor and a storehouse, in which their tools, provisions, and stores\r\n'b'would be kept. All the productions of the island, the flora as well as\r\n'b'the fauna, were to be there in the best possible state of preservation,\r\n'b'and completely sheltered from the damp. There was no want of space, so\r\n'b'that each object could be methodically arranged. Besides, the colonists\r\n'b'had still at their disposal the little grotto above the great cavern,\r\n'b'which was like the garret of the new dwelling.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This plan settled, it had only to be put into execution. The miners\r\n'b'became brickmakers again, then the bricks were brought to the foot of\r\n'b'Granite House. Till then, Harding and his companions had only entered\r\n'b'the cavern by the long passage. This mode of communication obliged them\r\n'b'first to climb Prospect Heights, making a detour by the river\xe2\x80\x99s bank,\r\n'b'and then to descend two hundred feet through the passage, having to\r\n'b'climb as far when they wished to return to the plateau. This was a great\r\n'b'loss of time, and was also very fatiguing. Cyrus Harding, therefore,\r\n'b'resolved to proceed without any further delay to the fabrication of\r\n'b'a strong rope ladder, which, once raised, would render Granite House\r\n'b'completely inaccessible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This ladder was manufactured with extreme care, and its uprights, formed\r\n'b'of the twisted fibers of a species of cane, had the strength of a thick\r\n'b'cable. As to the rounds, they were made of a sort of red cedar, with\r\n'b'light, strong branches; and this apparatus was wrought by the masterly\r\n'b'hand of Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Other ropes were made with vegetable fibers, and a sort of crane with a\r\n'b'tackle was fixed at the door. In this way bricks could easily be\r\n'b'raised into Granite House. The transport of the materials being thus\r\n'b'simplified, the arrangement of the interior could begin immediately.\r\n'b'There was no want of lime, and some thousands of bricks were there\r\n'b'ready to be used. The framework of the partitions was soon raised, very\r\n'b'roughly at first, and in a short time, the cave was divided into rooms\r\n'b'and storehouses, according to the plan agreed upon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These different works progressed rapidly under the direction of the\r\n'b'engineer, who himself handled the hammer and the trowel. No labor came\r\n'b'amiss to Cyrus Harding, who thus set an example to his intelligent and\r\n'b'zealous companions. They worked with confidence, even gaily, Pencroft\r\n'b'always having some joke to crack, sometimes carpenter, sometimes\r\n'b'rope-maker, sometimes mason, while he communicated his good humor to\r\n'b'all the members of their little world. His faith in the engineer\r\n'b'was complete; nothing could disturb it. He believed him capable of\r\n'b'undertaking anything and succeeding in everything. The question of boots\r\n'b'and clothes--assuredly a serious question,--that of light during the\r\n'b'winter months, utilizing the fertile parts of the island, transforming\r\n'b'the wild flora into cultivated flora, it all appeared easy to him; Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding helping, everything would be done in time. He dreamed of canals\r\n'b'facilitating the transport of the riches of the ground; workings\r\n'b'of quarries and mines; machines for every industrial manufacture;\r\n'b'railroads; yes, railroads! of which a network would certainly one day\r\n'b'cover Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer let Pencroft talk. He did not put down the aspirations of\r\n'b'this brave heart. He knew how communicable confidence is; he even smiled\r\n'b'to hear him speak, and said nothing of the uneasiness for the future\r\n'b'which he felt. In fact, in that part of the Pacific, out of the course\r\n'b'of vessels, it was to be feared that no help would ever come to them. It\r\n'b'was on themselves, on themselves alone, that the settlers must depend,\r\n'b'for the distance of Lincoln Island from all other land was such, that\r\n'b'to hazard themselves in a boat, of a necessarily inferior construction,\r\n'b'would be a serious and perilous thing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d as the sailor said, \xe2\x80\x9cthey quite took the wind out of the sails of\r\n'b'the Robinsons, for whom everything was done by a miracle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, they were energetic; an energetic man will succeed where an\r\n'b'indolent one would vegetate and inevitably perish.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert distinguished himself in these works. He was intelligent and\r\n'b'active; understanding quickly, he performed well; and Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'became more and more attached to the boy. Herbert had a lively and\r\n'b'reverent love for the engineer. Pencroft saw the close sympathy which\r\n'b'existed between the two, but he was not in the least jealous. Neb\r\n'b'was Neb: he was what he would be always, courage, zeal, devotion,\r\n'b'self-denial personified. He had the same faith in his master that\r\n'b'Pencroft had, but he showed it less vehemently. When the sailor was\r\n'b'enthusiastic, Neb always looked as if he would say, \xe2\x80\x9cNothing could be\r\n'b'more natural.\xe2\x80\x9d Pencroft and he were great friends.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to Gideon Spilett, he took part in the common work, and was not less\r\n'b'skilful in it than his companions, which always rather astonished\r\n'b'the sailor. A \xe2\x80\x9cjournalist,\xe2\x80\x9d clever, not only in understanding, but in\r\n'b'performing everything.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The ladder was finally fixed on the 28th of May. There were not less\r\n'b'than a hundred rounds in this perpendicular height of eighty feet.\r\n'b'Harding had been able, fortunately, to divide it in two parts, profiting\r\n'b'by an overhanging of the cliff which made a projection forty feet above\r\n'b'the ground. This projection, carefully leveled by the pickaxe, made a\r\n'b'sort of platform, to which they fixed the first ladder, of which the\r\n'b'oscillation was thus diminished one-half, and a rope permitted it to be\r\n'b'raised to the level of Granite House. As to the second ladder, it was\r\n'b'secured both at its lower part, which rested on the projection, and at\r\n'b'its upper end, which was fastened to the door. In short the ascent had\r\n'b'been made much easier. Besides, Cyrus Harding hoped later to establish\r\n'b'an hydraulic apparatus, which would avoid all fatigue and loss of time,\r\n'b'for the inhabitants of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers soon became habituated to the use of this ladder. They were\r\n'b'light and active, and Pencroft, as a sailor, accustomed to run up\r\n'b'the masts and shrouds, was able to give them lessons. But it was also\r\n'b'necessary to give them to Top. The poor dog, with his four paws, was\r\n'b'not formed for this sort of exercise. But Pencroft was such a zealous\r\n'b'master, that Top ended by properly performing his ascents, and soon\r\n'b'mounted the ladder as readily as his brethren in the circus. It need not\r\n'b'be said that the sailor was proud of his pupil. However, more than once\r\n'b'Pencroft hoisted him on his back, which Top never complained of.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It must be mentioned here, that during these works, which were actively\r\n'b'conducted, for the bad season was approaching, the alimentary question\r\n'b'was not neglected. Every day, the reporter and Herbert, who had been\r\n'b'voted purveyors to the colony, devoted some hours to the chase. As yet,\r\n'b'they only hunted in Jacamar Wood, on the left of the river, because, for\r\n'b'want of a bridge or boat, the Mercy had not yet been crossed. All the\r\n'b'immense woods, to which the name of the Forests of the Far West had been\r\n'b'given, were not explored. They reserved this important excursion for the\r\n'b'first fine days of the next spring. But Jacamar Wood was full of game;\r\n'b'kangaroos and boars abounded, and the hunters\xe2\x80\x99 iron-tipped spears and\r\n'b'bows and arrows did wonders. Besides, Herbert discovered towards the\r\n'b'southwest point of the lagoon a natural warren, a slightly damp meadow,\r\n'b'covered with willows and aromatic herbs which scented the air, such\r\n'b'as thyme, basil, savory, all the sweet-scented species of the labiated\r\n'b'plants, which the rabbits appeared to be particularly fond of.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the reporter observing that since the table was spread for the\r\n'b'rabbits, it was strange that the rabbits themselves should be wanting,\r\n'b'the two sportsmen carefully explored the warren. At any rate, it\r\n'b'produced an abundance of useful plants, and a naturalist would have had\r\n'b'a good opportunity of studying many specimens of the vegetable kingdom.\r\n'b'Herbert gathered several shoots of the basil, rosemary, balm, betony,\r\n'b'etc., which possess different medicinal properties, some pectoral,\r\n'b'astringent, febrifuge, others anti-spasmodic, or anti-rheumatic. When,\r\n'b'afterwards, Pencroft asked the use of this collection of herbs,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor medicine,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lad, \xe2\x80\x9cto treat us when we are ill.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy should we be ill, since there are no doctors in the island?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\n'b'Pencroft quite seriously.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no reply to be made to that, but the lad went on with his\r\n'b'collection all the same, and it was well received at Granite House.\r\n'b'Besides these medicinal herbs, he added a plant known in North America\r\n'b'as \xe2\x80\x9cOswego tea,\xe2\x80\x9d which made an excellent beverage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last, by searching thoroughly, the hunters arrived at the real site\r\n'b'of the warren. There the ground was perforated like a sieve.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere are the burrows!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cso I see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut are they inhabited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was soon answered. Almost immediately, hundreds of little animals,\r\n'b'similar to rabbits, fled in every direction, with such rapidity that\r\n'b'even Top could not overtake them. Hunters and dog ran in vain; these\r\n'b'rodents escaped them easily. But the reporter resolved not to leave the\r\n'b'place, until he had captured at least half-a-dozen of the quadrupeds.\r\n'b'He wished to stock their larder first, and domesticate those which they\r\n'b'might take later. It would not have been difficult to do this, with a\r\n'b'few snares stretched at the openings of the burrows. But at this moment\r\n'b'they had neither snares, nor anything to make them of. They must,\r\n'b'therefore, be satisfied with visiting each hole, and rummaging in it\r\n'b'with a stick, hoping by dint of patience to do what could not be done in\r\n'b'any other way.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last, after half an hour, four rodents were taken in their holes.\r\n'b'They were similar to their European brethren, and are commonly known by\r\n'b'the name of American rabbits.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This produce of the chase was brought back to Granite House, and figured\r\n'b'at the evening repast. The tenants of the warren were not at all to be\r\n'b'despised, for they were delicious. It was a valuable resource of the\r\n'b'colony, and it appeared to be inexhaustible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 31st of May the partitions were finished. The rooms had now only\r\n'b'to be furnished, and this would be work for the long winter days. A\r\n'b'chimney was established in the first room, which served as a kitchen.\r\n'b'The pipe destined to conduct the smoke outside gave some trouble to\r\n'b'these amateur bricklayers. It appeared simplest to Harding to make it of\r\n'b'brick clay; as creating an outlet for it to the upper plateau was not to\r\n'b'be thought of, a hole was pierced in the granite above the window of\r\n'b'the kitchen, and the pipe met it like that of an iron stove. Perhaps\r\n'b'the winds which blew directly against the facade would make the chimney\r\n'b'smoke, but these winds were rare, and besides, Master Neb, the cook, was\r\n'b'not so very particular about that.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When these interior arrangements were finished, the engineer occupied\r\n'b'himself in blocking up the outlet by the lake, so as to prevent any\r\n'b'access by that way. Masses of rock were rolled to the entrance and\r\n'b'strongly cemented together. Cyrus Harding did not yet realize his plan\r\n'b'of drowning this opening under the waters of the lake, by restoring\r\n'b'them to their former level by means of a dam. He contented himself with\r\n'b'hiding the obstruction with grass and shrubs, which were planted in the\r\n'b'interstices of the rocks, and which next spring would sprout thickly.\r\n'b'However, he used the waterfall so as to lead a small stream of fresh\r\n'b'water to the new dwelling. A little trench, made below their level,\r\n'b'produced this result; and this derivation from a pure and inexhaustible\r\n'b'source yielded twenty-five or thirty gallons a day. There would never be\r\n'b'any want of water at Granite House. At last all was finished, and it was\r\n'b'time, for the bad season was near. Thick shutters closed the windows of\r\n'b'the facade, until the engineer had time to make glass.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett had very artistically arranged on the rocky projections\r\n'b'around the windows plants of different kinds, as well as long streaming\r\n'b'grass, so that the openings were picturesquely framed in green, which\r\n'b'had a pleasing effect.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The inhabitants of this solid, healthy, and secure dwelling, could not\r\n'b'but be charmed with their work. The view from the windows extended over\r\n'b'a boundless horizon, which was closed by the two Mandible Capes on the\r\n'b'north, and Claw Cape on the south. All Union Bay was spread before them.\r\n'b'Yes, our brave settlers had reason to be satisfied, and Pencroft was\r\n'b'lavish in his praise of what he humorously called, \xe2\x80\x9chis apartments on\r\n'b'the fifth floor above the ground!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 20\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The winter season set in with the month of June, which corresponds with\r\n'b'the month of December in the Northern Hemisphere. It began with showers\r\n'b'and squalls, which succeeded each other without intermission. The\r\n'b'tenants of Granite House could appreciate the advantages of a dwelling\r\n'b'which sheltered them from the inclement weather. The Chimneys would have\r\n'b'been quite insufficient to protect them against the rigor of winter, and\r\n'b'it was to be feared that the high tides would make another irruption.\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had taken precautions against this contingency, so as\r\n'b'to preserve as much as possible the forge and furnace which were\r\n'b'established there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the whole of the month of June the time was employed in different\r\n'b'occupations, which excluded neither hunting nor fishing, the larder\r\n'b'being, therefore, abundantly supplied. Pencroft, so soon as he had\r\n'b'leisure, proposed to set some traps, from which he expected great\r\n'b'results. He soon made some snares with creepers, by the aid of which the\r\n'b'warren henceforth every day furnished its quota of rodents. Neb employed\r\n'b'nearly all his time in salting or smoking meat, which insured their\r\n'b'always having plenty of provisions. The question of clothes was now\r\n'b'seriously discussed, the settlers having no other garments than those\r\n'b'they wore when the balloon threw them on the island. These clothes were\r\n'b'warm and good; they had taken great care of them as well as of their\r\n'b'linen, and they were perfectly whole, but they would soon need to be\r\n'b'replaced. Moreover, if the winter was severe, the settlers would suffer\r\n'b'greatly from cold.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this subject the ingenuity of Harding was at fault. They must provide\r\n'b'for their most pressing wants, settle their dwelling, and lay in a\r\n'b'store of food; thus the cold might come upon them before the question\r\n'b'of clothes had been settled. They must therefore make up their minds to\r\n'b'pass this first winter without additional clothing. When the fine season\r\n'b'came round again, they would regularly hunt those musmons which had been\r\n'b'seen on the expedition to Mount Franklin, and the wool once collected,\r\n'b'the engineer would know how to make it into strong warm stuff.... How?\r\n'b'He would consider.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we are free to roast ourselves at Granite House!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are heaps of fuel, and no reason for sparing it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides,\xe2\x80\x9d added Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln Island is not situated under\r\n'b'a very high latitude, and probably the winters here are not severe. Did\r\n'b'you not say, Cyrus, that this thirty-fifth parallel corresponded to that\r\n'b'of Spain in the other hemisphere?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut some winters in Spain are very\r\n'b'cold! No want of snow and ice; and perhaps Lincoln Island is just as\r\n'b'rigorously tried. However, it is an island, and as such, I hope that\r\n'b'the temperature will be more moderate.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the sea, my boy, may be considered as an immense reservoir, in\r\n'b'which is stored the heat of the summer. When winter comes, it restores\r\n'b'this heat, which insures for the regions near the ocean a medium\r\n'b'temperature, less high in summer, but less low in winter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall prove that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cBut I don\xe2\x80\x99t want to bother\r\n'b'myself about whether it will be cold or not. One thing is certain, that\r\n'b'is that the days are already short, and the evenings long. Suppose we\r\n'b'talk about the question of light.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is easier,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo talk about?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo settle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd when shall we begin?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, by having a seal hunt.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo make candles?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Such was the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s project; and it was quite feasible, since he had\r\n'b'lime and sulphuric acid, while the amphibians of the islet would furnish\r\n'b'the fat necessary for the manufacture.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were now at the 4th of June. It was Whit Sunday and they agreed to\r\n'b'observe this feast. All work was suspended, and prayers were offered\r\n'b'to Heaven. But these prayers were now thanksgivings. The settlers in\r\n'b'Lincoln Island were no longer the miserable castaways thrown on the\r\n'b'islet. They asked for nothing more--they gave thanks. The next day, the\r\n'b'5th of June, in rather uncertain weather, they set out for the islet.\r\n'b'They had to profit by the low tide to cross the Channel, and it was\r\n'b'agreed that they would construct, for this purpose, as well as they\r\n'b'could, a boat which would render communication so much easier, and\r\n'b'would also permit them to ascend the Mercy, at the time of their grand\r\n'b'exploration of the southwest of the island, which was put off till the\r\n'b'first fine days.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The seals were numerous, and the hunters, armed with their iron-tipped\r\n'b'spears, easily killed half-a-dozen. Neb and Pencroft skinned them, and\r\n'b'only brought back to Granite House their fat and skin, this skin being\r\n'b'intended for the manufacture of boots.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The result of the hunt was this: nearly three hundred pounds of fat, all\r\n'b'to be employed in the fabrication of candles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The operation was extremely simple, and if it did not yield absolutely\r\n'b'perfect results, they were at least very useful. Cyrus Harding would\r\n'b'only have had at his disposal sulphuric acid, but by heating this acid\r\n'b'with the neutral fatty bodies he could separate the glycerine; then from\r\n'b'this new combination, he easily separated the olein, the margarin, and\r\n'b'the stearin, by employing boiling water. But to simplify the operation,\r\n'b'he preferred to saponify the fat by means of lime. By this he obtained a\r\n'b'calcareous soap, easy to decompose by sulphuric acid, which precipitated\r\n'b'the lime into the state of sulphate, and liberated the fatty acids.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From these three acids-oleic, margaric, and stearic-the first, being\r\n'b'liquid, was driven out by a sufficient pressure. As to the two others,\r\n'b'they formed the very substance of which the candles were to be molded.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This operation did not last more than four and twenty hours. The wicks,\r\n'b'after several trials, were made of vegetable fibers, and dipped in the\r\n'b'liquefied substance, they formed regular stearic candles, molded by the\r\n'b'hand, which only wanted whiteness and polish. They would not doubtless\r\n'b'have the advantages of the wicks which are impregnated with boracic\r\n'b'acid, and which vitrify as they burn and are entirely consumed, but\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding having manufactured a beautiful pair of snuffers, these\r\n'b'candles would be greatly appreciated during the long evenings in Granite\r\n'b'House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this month there was no want of work in the interior of their new\r\n'b'dwelling. The joiners had plenty to do. They improved their tools, which\r\n'b'were very rough, and added others also.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Scissors were made among other things, and the settlers were at last\r\n'b'able to cut their hair, and also to shave, or at least trim their\r\n'b'beards. Herbert had none, Neb but little, but their companions were\r\n'b'bristling in a way which justified the making of the said scissors.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The manufacture of a hand-saw cost infinite trouble, but at last an\r\n'b'instrument was obtained which, when vigorously handled, could divide the\r\n'b'ligneous fibers of the wood. They then made tables, seats, cupboards,\r\n'b'to furnish the principal rooms, and bedsteads, of which all the bedding\r\n'b'consisted of grass mattresses. The kitchen, with its shelves, on which\r\n'b'rested the cooking utensils, its brick stove, looked very well, and Neb\r\n'b'worked away there as earnestly as if he was in a chemist\xe2\x80\x99s laboratory.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the joiners had soon to be replaced by carpenters. In fact, the\r\n'b'waterfall created by the explosion rendered the construction of two\r\n'b'bridges necessary, one on Prospect Heights, the other on the shore. Now\r\n'b'the plateau and the shore were transversely divided by a watercourse,\r\n'b'which had to be crossed to reach the northern part of the island. To\r\n'b'avoid it the colonists had been obliged to make a considerable detour,\r\n'b'by climbing up to the source of the Red Creek. The simplest thing was to\r\n'b'establish on the plateau, and on the shore, two bridges from twenty to\r\n'b'five and twenty feet in length. All the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s work that was needed\r\n'b'was to clear some trees of their branches: this was a business of some\r\n'b'days. Directly the bridges were established, Neb and Pencroft profited\r\n'b'by them to go to the oyster-bed which had been discovered near the\r\n'b'downs. They dragged with them a sort of rough cart, which replaced the\r\n'b'former inconvenient hurdle, and brought back some thousands of oysters,\r\n'b'which soon increased among the rocks and formed a bed at the mouth of\r\n'b'the Mercy. These molluscs were of excellent quality, and the colonists\r\n'b'consumed some daily.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It has been seen that Lincoln Island, although its inhabitants had as\r\n'b'yet only explored a small portion of it, already contributed to almost\r\n'b'all their wants. It was probable that if they hunted into its most\r\n'b'secret recesses, in all the wooded part between the Mercy and Reptile\r\n'b'Point, they would find new treasures.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers in Lincoln Island had still one privation. There was no\r\n'b'want of meat, nor of vegetable products; those ligneous roots which\r\n'b'they had found, when subjected to fermentation, gave them an acid drink,\r\n'b'which was preferable to cold water; they also made sugar, without canes\r\n'b'or beet-roots, by collecting the liquor which distils from the \xe2\x80\x9cacer\r\n'b'saceharinum,\xe2\x80\x9d a sort of maple-tree, which flourishes in all the temperate\r\n'b'zones, and of which the island possessed a great number; they made\r\n'b'a very agreeable tea by employing the herbs brought from the warren;\r\n'b'lastly, they had an abundance of salt, the only mineral which is used in\r\n'b'food... but bread was wanting.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Perhaps in time the settlers could replace this want by some equivalent,\r\n'b'it was possible that they might find the sago or the breadfruit tree\r\n'b'among the forests of the south, but they had not as yet met with these\r\n'b'precious trees. However, Providence came directly to their aid, in an\r\n'b'infinitesimal proportion it is true, but Cyrus Harding, with all his\r\n'b'intelligence, all his ingenuity, would never have been able to produce\r\n'b'that which, by the greatest chance, Herbert one day found in the lining\r\n'b'of his waistcoat, which he was occupied in setting to rights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this day, as it was raining in torrents, the settlers were assembled\r\n'b'in the great hall in Granite House, when the lad cried out all at\r\n'b'once,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, captain--A grain of corn!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And he showed his companions a grain--a single grain--which from a hole\r\n'b'in his pocket had got into the lining of his waistcoat.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The presence of this grain was explained by the fact that Herbert, when\r\n'b'at Richmond, used to feed some pigeons, of which Pencroft had made him a\r\n'b'present.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA grain of corn?\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer quickly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, captain; but one, only one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\xe2\x80\x99re getting on capitally,\r\n'b'upon my word! What shall we make with one grain of corn?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will make bread of it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBread, cakes, tarts!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cCome, the bread that this\r\n'b'grain of corn will make won\xe2\x80\x99t choke us very soon!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert, not attaching much importance to his discovery, was going to\r\n'b'throw away the grain in question; but Harding took it, examined it,\r\n'b'found that it was in good condition, and looking the sailor full in the\r\n'b'face--\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked quietly, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know how many ears one grain\r\n'b'of corn can produce?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne, I suppose!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, surprised at the question.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTen, Pencroft! And do you know how many grains one ear bears?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, upon my word.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout eighty!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, if we plant this grain, at\r\n'b'the first crop we shall reap eight hundred grains which at the second\r\n'b'will produce six hundred and forty thousand; at the third, five hundred\r\n'b'and twelve millions; at the fourth, more than four hundred thousands of\r\n'b'millions! There is the proportion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding\xe2\x80\x99s companions listened without answering. These numbers\r\n'b'astonished them. They were exact, however.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9csuch are the arithmetical\r\n'b'progressions of prolific nature; and yet what is this multiplication\r\n'b'of the grain of corn, of which the ear only bears eight hundred grains,\r\n'b'compared to the poppy-plant, which bears thirty-two thousand seeds; to\r\n'b'the tobacco-plant, which produces three hundred and sixty thousand? In\r\n'b'a few years, without the numerous causes of destruction, which arrests\r\n'b'their fecundity, these plants would overrun the earth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the engineer had not finished his lecture.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you know how many bushels four\r\n'b'hundred thousand millions of grains would make?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what I do know is, that I am nothing\r\n'b'better than a fool!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, they would make more than three millions, at a hundred and thirty\r\n'b'thousand a bushel, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThree millions!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThree millions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn four years?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn four years,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand even in two years, if, as I\r\n'b'hope, in this latitude we can obtain two crops a year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that, according to his usual custom, Pencroft could not reply\r\n'b'otherwise than by a tremendous hurrah.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d added the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have made a discovery of great\r\n'b'importance to us. Everything, my friends, everything can serve us in the\r\n'b'condition in which we are. Do not forget that, I beg of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, captain, no, we shan\xe2\x80\x99t forget it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cand if ever\r\n'b'I find one of those tobacco-seeds, which multiply by three hundred and\r\n'b'sixty thousand, I assure you I won\xe2\x80\x99t throw it away! And now, what must\r\n'b'we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must plant this grain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d added Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand with every possible care, for it bears\r\n'b'in itself our future harvests.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cProvided it grows!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will grow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was the 20th of June. The time was then propitious for sowing this\r\n'b'single precious grain of corn. It was first proposed to plant it in\r\n'b'a pot, but upon reflection it was decided to leave it to nature, and\r\n'b'confide it to the earth. This was done that very day, and it is needless\r\n'b'to add, that every precaution was taken that the experiment might\r\n'b'succeed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The weather having cleared, the settlers climbed the height above\r\n'b'Granite House. There, on the plateau, they chose a spot, well sheltered\r\n'b'from the wind, and exposed to all the heat of the midday sun. The place\r\n'b'was cleared, carefully weeded, and searched for insects and worms;\r\n'b'then a bed of good earth, improved with a little lime, was made; it was\r\n'b'surrounded by a railing; and the grain was buried in the damp earth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Did it not seem as if the settlers were laying the first stone of some\r\n'b'edifice? It recalled to Pencroft the day on which he lighted his only\r\n'b'match, and all the anxiety of the operation. But this time the thing\r\n'b'was more serious. In fact, the castaways would have been always able\r\n'b'to procure fire, in some mode or other, but no human power could supply\r\n'b'another grain of corn, if unfortunately this should be lost!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 21\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From this time Pencroft did not let a single day pass without going to\r\n'b'visit what he gravely called his \xe2\x80\x9ccorn-field.\xe2\x80\x9d And woe to the insects\r\n'b'which dared to venture there! No mercy was shown them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards the end of the month of June, after incessant rain, the weather\r\n'b'became decidedly colder, and on the 29th a Fahrenheit thermometer\r\n'b'would certainly have announced only twenty degrees above zero, that is\r\n'b'considerably below the freezing-point. The next day, the 30th of June,\r\n'b'the day which corresponds to the 31st of December in the northern year,\r\n'b'was a Friday. Neb remarked that the year finished on a bad day, but\r\n'b'Pencroft replied that naturally the next would begin on a good one,\r\n'b'which was better.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At any rate it commenced by very severe cold. Ice accumulated at the\r\n'b'mouth of the Mercy, and it was not long before the whole expanse of the\r\n'b'lake was frozen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers had frequently been obliged to renew their store of wood.\r\n'b'Pencroft also had wisely not waited till the river was frozen, but had\r\n'b'brought enormous rafts of wood to their destination. The current was\r\n'b'an indefatigable moving power, and it was employed in conveying the\r\n'b'floating wood to the moment when the frost enchained it. To the fuel\r\n'b'which was so abundantly supplied by the forest, they added several\r\n'b'cartloads of coal, which had to be brought from the foot of the spurs of\r\n'b'Mount Franklin. The powerful heat of the coal was greatly appreciated in\r\n'b'the low temperature, which on the 4th of July fell to eight degrees of\r\n'b'Fahrenheit, that is, thirteen degrees below zero. A second fireplace had\r\n'b'been established in the dining-room, where they all worked together at\r\n'b'their different avocations. During this period of cold, Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'had great cause to congratulate himself on having brought to Granite\r\n'b'House the little stream of water from Lake Grant. Taken below the frozen\r\n'b'surface, and conducted through the passage, it preserved its fluidity,\r\n'b'and arrived at an interior reservoir which had been hollowed out at the\r\n'b'back part of the storeroom, while the overflow ran through the well to\r\n'b'the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About this time, the weather being extremely dry, the colonists, clothed\r\n'b'as warmly as possible, resolved to devote a day to the exploration of\r\n'b'that part of the island between the Mercy and Claw Cape. It was a wide\r\n'b'extent of marshy land, and they would probably find good sport, for\r\n'b'water-birds ought to swarm there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They reckoned that it would be about eight or nine miles to go there,\r\n'b'and as much to return, so that the whole of the day would be occupied.\r\n'b'As an unknown part of the island was about to be explored, the whole\r\n'b'colony took part in the expedition. Accordingly, on the 5th of July, at\r\n'b'six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, when day had scarcely broken, Cyrus Harding,\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft, armed with spears, snares,\r\n'b'bows and arrows, and provided with provisions, left Granite House,\r\n'b'preceded by Top, who bounded before them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their shortest way was to cross the Mercy on the ice, which then covered\r\n'b'it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d as the engineer justly observed, \xe2\x80\x9cthat could not take the place\r\n'b'of a regular bridge!\xe2\x80\x9d So, the construction of a regular bridge was noted\r\n'b'in the list of future works.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the first time that the settlers had set foot on the right bank\r\n'b'of the Mercy, and ventured into the midst of those gigantic and superb\r\n'b'coniferae now sprinkled over with snow.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But they had not gone half a mile when from a thicket a whole family of\r\n'b'quadrupeds, who had made a home there, disturbed by Top, rushed forth\r\n'b'into the open country.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh! I should say those are foxes!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, when he saw the troop\r\n'b'rapidly decamping.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were foxes, but of a very large size, who uttered a sort of\r\n'b'barking, at which Top seemed to be very much astonished, for he stopped\r\n'b'short in the chase, and gave the swift animals time to disappear.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The dog had reason to be surprised, as he did not know Natural History.\r\n'b'But, by their barking, these foxes, with reddish-gray hair, black tails\r\n'b'terminating in a white tuft, had betrayed their origin. So Herbert\r\n'b'was able, without hesitating, to give them their real name of \xe2\x80\x9cArctic\r\n'b'foxes.\xe2\x80\x9d They are frequently met with in Chile, in the Falkland Islands,\r\n'b'and in all parts of America traversed by the thirtieth and fortieth\r\n'b'parallels. Herbert much regretted that Top had not been able to catch\r\n'b'one of these carnivora.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre they good to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft, who only regarded the\r\n'b'representatives of the fauna in the island from one special point of\r\n'b'view.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut zoologists have not yet found out if the\r\n'b'eye of these foxes is diurnal or nocturnal, or whether it is correct to\r\n'b'class them in the genus dog, properly so called.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding could not help smiling on hearing the lad\xe2\x80\x99s reflection, which\r\n'b'showed a thoughtful mind. As to the sailor, from the moment when he\r\n'b'found that the foxes were not classed in the genus eatable, they were\r\n'b'nothing to him. However, when a poultry-yard was established at Granite\r\n'b'House, he observed that it would be best to take some precautions\r\n'b'against a probable visit from these four-legged plunderers, and no one\r\n'b'disputed this.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After having turned the point, the settlers saw a long beach washed by\r\n'b'the open sea. It was then eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning. The sky was very\r\n'b'clear, as it often is after prolonged cold; but warmed by their walk,\r\n'b'neither Harding nor his companions felt the sharpness of the atmosphere\r\n'b'too severely. Besides there was no wind, which made it much more\r\n'b'bearable. A brilliant sun, but without any calorific action, was just\r\n'b'issuing from the ocean. The sea was as tranquil and blue as that of a\r\n'b'Mediterranean gulf, when the sky is clear. Claw Cape, bent in the form\r\n'b'of a yataghan, tapered away nearly four miles to the southeast. To\r\n'b'the left the edge of the marsh was abruptly ended by a little point.\r\n'b'Certainly, in this part of Union Bay, which nothing sheltered from the\r\n'b'open sea, not even a sandbank, ships beaten by the east winds would\r\n'b'have found no shelter. They perceived by the tranquillity of the sea, in\r\n'b'which no shallows troubled the waters, by its uniform color, which was\r\n'b'stained by no yellow shades, by the absence of even a reef, that the\r\n'b'coast was steep and that the ocean there covered a deep abyss. Behind in\r\n'b'the west, but at a distance of four miles, rose the first trees of the\r\n'b'forests of the Far West. They might have believed themselves to be on\r\n'b'the desolate coast of some island in the Antarctic regions which the ice\r\n'b'had invaded. The colonists halted at this place for breakfast. A fire of\r\n'b'brushwood and dried seaweed was lighted, and Neb prepared the breakfast\r\n'b'of cold meat, to which he added some cups of Oswego tea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While eating they looked around them. This part of Lincoln Island was\r\n'b'very sterile, and contrasted with all the western part. The reporter\r\n'b'was thus led to observe that if chance had thrown them at first on the\r\n'b'shore, they would have had but a deplorable idea of their future domain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI believe that we should not have been able to reach it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\n'b'engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the sea is deep, and there is not a rock on which we\r\n'b'could have taken refuge. Before Granite House, at least, there were\r\n'b'sandbanks, an islet, which multiplied our chances of safety. Here,\r\n'b'nothing but the depths!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is singular enough,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this comparatively\r\n'b'small island should present such varied ground. This diversity of\r\n'b'aspect, logically only belongs to continents of a certain extent. One\r\n'b'would really say, that the western part of Lincoln Island, so rich and\r\n'b'so fertile, is washed by the warm waters of the Gulf of Mexico, and that\r\n'b'its shores to the north and the southeast extend over a sort of Arctic\r\n'b'sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, my dear Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cI have also\r\n'b'observed this. I think the form and also the nature of this island\r\n'b'strange. It is a summary of all the aspects which a continent presents,\r\n'b'and I should not be surprised if it was a continent formerly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! a continent in the middle of the Pacific?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cWhy should not Australia, New\r\n'b'Ireland, Australasia, united to the archipelagoes of the Pacific, have\r\n'b'once formed a sixth part of the world, as important as Europe or Asia,\r\n'b'as Africa or the two Americas? To my mind, it is quite possible that all\r\n'b'these islands, emerging from this vast ocean, are but the summits of\r\n'b'a continent, now submerged, but which was above the waters at a\r\n'b'prehistoric period.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs the Atlantis was formerly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy... if, however, it existed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd would Lincoln Island have been a part of that continent?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\n'b'Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is probable,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand that would sufficiently,\r\n'b'explain the variety of productions which are seen on its surface.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the great number of animals which still inhabit it,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand you furnish me with an\r\n'b'argument to support my theory. It is certain, after what we have seen,\r\n'b'that animals are numerous in this island, and what is more strange, that\r\n'b'the species are extremely varied. There is a reason for that, and to\r\n'b'me it is that Lincoln Island may have formerly been a part of some vast\r\n'b'continent which had gradually sunk below the Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, some fine day,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, who did not appear to be entirely\r\n'b'convinced, \xe2\x80\x9cthe rest of this ancient continent may disappear in its\r\n'b'turn, and there will be nothing between America and Asia.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cthere will be new continents which millions and\r\n'b'millions of animalculae are building at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what are these masons?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCoral insects,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cBy constant work they made the\r\n'b'island of Clermont-Tonnerre, and numerous other coral islands in the\r\n'b'Pacific Ocean. Forty-seven millions of these insects are needed to weigh\r\n'b'a grain, and yet, with the sea-salt they absorb, the solid elements of\r\n'b'water which they assimilate, these animalculae produce limestone, and\r\n'b'this limestone forms enormous submarine erections, of which the hardness\r\n'b'and solidity equal granite. Formerly, at the first periods of creation,\r\n'b'nature employing fire, heaved up the land, but now she entrusts to these\r\n'b'microscopic creatures the task of replacing this agent, of which\r\n'b'the dynamic power in the interior of the globe has evidently\r\n'b'diminished--which is proved by the number of volcanoes on the surface of\r\n'b'the earth, now actually extinct. And I believe that centuries succeeding\r\n'b'to centuries, and insects to insects, this Pacific may one day be\r\n'b'changed into a vast continent, which new generations will inhabit and\r\n'b'civilize in their turn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat will take a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNature has time for it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what would be the use of new continents?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\n'b'appears to me that the present extent of habitable countries is\r\n'b'sufficient for humanity. Yet nature does nothing uselessly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing uselessly, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut this is\r\n'b'how the necessity of new continents for the future, and exactly on the\r\n'b'tropical zone occupied by the coral islands, may be explained. At least\r\n'b'to me this explanation appears plausible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are listening, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is my idea: philosophers generally admit that some day our globe\r\n'b'will end, or rather that animal and vegetable life will no longer be\r\n'b'possible, because of the intense cold to which it will be subjected.\r\n'b'What they are not agreed upon, is the cause of this cold. Some think\r\n'b'that it will arise from the falling of the temperature, which the\r\n'b'sun will experience after millions of years; others, from the gradual\r\n'b'extinction of the fires in the interior of our globe, which have a\r\n'b'greater influence on it than is generally supposed. I hold to this last\r\n'b'hypothesis, grounding it on the fact that the moon is really a cold\r\n'b'star, which is no longer habitable, although the sun continues to throw\r\n'b'on its surface the same amount of heat. If, then, the moon has become\r\n'b'cold, it is because the interior fires to which, as do all the stars of\r\n'b'the stellar world, it owes its origin, are completely extinct. Lastly,\r\n'b'whatever may be the cause, our globe will become cold some day, but this\r\n'b'cold will only operate gradually. What will happen, then? The temperate\r\n'b'zones, at a more or less distant period, will not be more habitable than\r\n'b'the polar regions now are. Then the population of men, as well as the\r\n'b'animals, will flow towards the latitudes which are more directly under\r\n'b'the solar influence. An immense emigration will take place. Europe,\r\n'b'Central Asia, North America, will gradually be abandoned, as well as\r\n'b'Australasia and the lower parts of South America. The vegetation will\r\n'b'follow the human emigration. The flora will retreat towards the Equator\r\n'b'at the same time as the fauna. The central parts of South America and\r\n'b'Africa will be the continents chiefly inhabited. The Laplanders and the\r\n'b'Samoides will find the climate of the polar regions on the shores of the\r\n'b'Mediterranean. Who can say, that at this period, the equatorial regions\r\n'b'will not be too small, to contain and nourish terrestrial humanity? Now,\r\n'b'may not provident nature, so as to give refuge to all the vegetable\r\n'b'and animal emigration, be at present laying the foundation of a new\r\n'b'continent under the Equator, and may she not have entrusted these\r\n'b'insects with the construction of it? I have often thought of all these\r\n'b'things, my friends, and I seriously believe that the aspect of our\r\n'b'globe will some day be completely changed; that by the raising of new\r\n'b'continents the sea will cover the old, and that, in future ages,\r\n'b'a Columbus will go to discover the islands of Chimborazo, of the\r\n'b'Himalayas, or of Mont Blanc, remains of a submerged America, Asia,\r\n'b'and Europe. Then these new continents will become, in their turn,\r\n'b'uninhabitable; heat will die away, as does the heat from a body when\r\n'b'the soul has left it; and life will disappear from the globe, if not for\r\n'b'ever, at least for a period. Perhaps then, our spheroid will rest--will\r\n'b'be left to death--to revive some day under superior conditions! But\r\n'b'all that, my friends, is the secret of the Author of all things; and\r\n'b'beginning by the work of the insects, I have perhaps let myself be\r\n'b'carried too far, in investigating the secrets of the future.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthese theories are prophecies to me,\r\n'b'and they will be accomplished some day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the secret of God,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll that is well and good,\xe2\x80\x9d then said Pencroft, who had listened with\r\n'b'all his might, \xe2\x80\x9cbut will you tell me, captain, if Lincoln Island has\r\n'b'been made by your insects?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cit is of a purely volcanic origin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen it will disappear some day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is probable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hope we won\xe2\x80\x99t be here then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, don\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy, Pencroft; we shall not be here then, as we have no\r\n'b'wish to die here, and hope to get away some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9clet us establish ourselves\r\n'b'here as if forever. There is no use in doing things by halves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This ended the conversation. Breakfast was finished, the exploration was\r\n'b'continued, and the settlers arrived at the border of the marshy\r\n'b'region. It was a marsh of which the extent, to the rounded coast which\r\n'b'terminated the island at the southeast, was about twenty square miles.\r\n'b'The soil was formed of clayey flint-earth, mingled with vegetable\r\n'b'matter, such as the remains of rushes, reeds, grass, etc. Here and there\r\n'b'beds of grass, thick as a carpet, covered it. In many places icy pools\r\n'b'sparkled in the sun. Neither rain nor any river, increased by a sudden\r\n'b'swelling, could supply these ponds. They therefore naturally concluded\r\n'b'that the marsh was fed by the infiltrations of the soil and it was\r\n'b'really so. It was also to be feared that during the heat miasmas would\r\n'b'arise, which might produce fevers.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Above the aquatic plants, on the surface of the stagnant water,\r\n'b'fluttered numbers of birds. Wild duck, teal, snipe lived there in\r\n'b'flocks, and those fearless birds allowed themselves to be easily\r\n'b'approached.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'One shot from a gun would certainly have brought down some dozen of the\r\n'b'birds, they were so close together. The explorers were, however, obliged\r\n'b'to content themselves with bows and arrows. The result was less, but the\r\n'b'silent arrow had the advantage of not frightening the birds, while the\r\n'b'noise of firearms would have dispersed them to all parts of the marsh.\r\n'b'The hunters were satisfied, for this time, with a dozen ducks, which had\r\n'b'white bodies with a band of cinnamon, a green head, wings black, white,\r\n'b'and red, and flattened beak. Herbert called them tadorns. Top helped in\r\n'b'the capture of these birds, whose name was given to this marshy part of\r\n'b'the island. The settlers had here an abundant reserve of aquatic game.\r\n'b'At some future time they meant to explore it more carefully, and it was\r\n'b'probable that some of the birds there might be domesticated, or at least\r\n'b'brought to the shores of the lake, so that they would be more within\r\n'b'their reach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening Cyrus Harding and his companions\r\n'b'retraced their steps to their dwelling by traversing Tadorn\xe2\x80\x99s Fens, and\r\n'b'crossed the Mercy on the ice-bridge.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At eight in the evening they all entered Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 22\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This intense cold lasted till the 15th of August, without, however,\r\n'b'passing the degree of Fahrenheit already mentioned. When the atmosphere\r\n'b'was calm, the low temperature was easily borne, but when the wind blew,\r\n'b'the poor settlers, insufficiently clothed, felt it severely. Pencroft\r\n'b'regretted that Lincoln Island was not the home of a few families of\r\n'b'bears rather than of so many foxes and seals.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBears,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9care generally very well dressed, and I ask no more\r\n'b'than to borrow for the winter the warm cloaks which they have on their\r\n'b'backs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps the bears would not consent to\r\n'b'give you their cloaks, Pencroft. These beasts are not St. Martins.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe would make them do it, Neb, we would make them,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft,\r\n'b'in quite an authoritative tone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But these formidable carnivora did not exist in the island, or at any\r\n'b'rate they had not yet shown themselves.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, Herbert, Pencroft, and the reporter occupied\r\n'b'themselves with making traps on Prospect Heights and at the border of\r\n'b'the forest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'According to the sailor, any animal, whatever it was, would be a lawful\r\n'b'prize, and the rodents or carnivora which might get into the new snares\r\n'b'would be well received at Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The traps were besides extremely simple; being pits dug in the ground,\r\n'b'a platform of branches and grass above, which concealed the opening, and\r\n'b'at the bottom some bait, the scent of which would attract animals. It\r\n'b'must be mentioned also, that they had not been dug at random, but\r\n'b'at certain places where numerous footprints showed that quadrupeds\r\n'b'frequented the ground. They were visited every day, and at three\r\n'b'different times, during the first days, specimens of those Antarctic\r\n'b'foxes which they had already seen on the right bank of the Mercy were\r\n'b'found in them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, there are nothing but foxes in this country!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, when\r\n'b'for the third time he drew one of the animals out of the pit. Looking at\r\n'b'it in great disgust, he added, \xe2\x80\x9cbeasts which are good for nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are good for something!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo make bait to attract other creatures!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter was right, and the traps were henceforward baited with the\r\n'b'foxes carcasses.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor had also made snares from the long tough fibers of a certain\r\n'b'plant, and they were even more successful than the traps. Rarely a day\r\n'b'passed without some rabbits from the warren being caught. It was always\r\n'b'rabbit, but Neb knew how to vary his sauces and the settlers did not\r\n'b'think of complaining.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, once or twice in the second week of August, the traps supplied\r\n'b'the hunters with other animals more useful than foxes, namely, several\r\n'b'of those small wild boars which had already been seen to the north of\r\n'b'the lake. Pencroft had no need to ask if these beasts were eatable. He\r\n'b'could see that by their resemblance to the pig of America and Europe.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut these are not pigs,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI warn you of that,\r\n'b'Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, bending over the trap and drawing out one\r\n'b'of these representatives of the family of sus by the little appendage\r\n'b'which served it as a tail. \xe2\x80\x9cLet me believe that these are pigs.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause that pleases me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you very fond of pig then, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am very fond of pig,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cparticularly of its feet,\r\n'b'and if it had eight instead of four, I should like it twice as much!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the animals in question, they were peccaries belonging to one of\r\n'b'the four species which are included in the family, and they were also of\r\n'b'the species of Tajacu, recognizable by their deep color and the absence\r\n'b'of those long teeth with which the mouths of their congeners are armed.\r\n'b'These peccaries generally live in herds, and it was probable that they\r\n'b'abounded in the woody parts of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At any rate, they were eatable from head to foot, and Pencroft did not\r\n'b'ask more from them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards the 15th of August, the state of the atmosphere was suddenly\r\n'b'moderated by the wind shifting to the northwest. The temperature rose\r\n'b'some degrees, and the accumulated vapor in the air was not long in\r\n'b'resolving into snow. All the island was covered with a sheet of white,\r\n'b'and showed itself to its inhabitants under a new aspect. The snow fell\r\n'b'abundantly for several days, and it soon reached a thickness of two\r\n'b'feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The wind also blew with great violence, and at the height of Granite\r\n'b'House the sea could be heard thundering against the reefs. In some\r\n'b'places, the wind, eddying round the corners, formed the snow into tall\r\n'b'whirling columns, resembling those waterspouts which turn round on their\r\n'b'base, and which vessels attack with a shot from a gun. However, the\r\n'b'storm, coming from the northwest, blew across the island, and the\r\n'b'position of Granite House preserved it from a direct attack.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But in the midst of this snow-storm, as terrible as if it had been\r\n'b'produced in some polar country, neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions\r\n'b'could, notwithstanding their wish for it, venture forth, and they\r\n'b'remained shut up for five days, from the 20th to the 25th of August.\r\n'b'They could hear the tempest raging in Jacamar Wood, which would surely\r\n'b'suffer from it. Many of the trees would no doubt be torn up by the\r\n'b'roots, but Pencroft consoled himself by thinking that he would not have\r\n'b'the trouble of cutting them down.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe wind is turning woodman, let it alone,\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Besides, there was no way of stopping it, if they had wished to do so.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'How grateful the inhabitants of Granite House then were to Heaven for\r\n'b'having prepared for them this solid and immovable retreat! Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'had also his legitimate share of thanks, but after all, it was Nature\r\n'b'who had hollowed out this vast cavern, and he had only discovered it.\r\n'b'There all were in safety, and the tempest could not reach them. If\r\n'b'they had constructed a house of bricks and wood on Prospect Heights,\r\n'b'it certainly would not have resisted the fury of this storm. As to\r\n'b'the Chimneys, it must have been absolutely uninhabitable, for the sea,\r\n'b'passing over the islet, would beat furiously against it. But here, in\r\n'b'Granite House, in the middle of a solid mass, over which neither the sea\r\n'b'nor air had any influence, there was nothing to fear.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During these days of seclusion the settlers did not remain inactive.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no want of wood, cut up into planks, in the storeroom, and\r\n'b'little by little they completed their furnishing; constructing the\r\n'b'most solid of tables and chairs, for material was not spared. Neb and\r\n'b'Pencroft were very proud of this rather heavy furniture, which they\r\n'b'would not have changed on any account.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then the carpenters became basket-makers, and they did not succeed badly\r\n'b'in this new manufacture. At the point of the lake which projected to the\r\n'b'north, they had discovered an osier-bed in which grew a large number\r\n'b'of purple osiers. Before the rainy season, Pencroft and Herbert had cut\r\n'b'down these useful shrubs, and their branches, well prepared, could now\r\n'b'be effectively employed. The first attempts were somewhat crude, but\r\n'b'in consequence of the cleverness and intelligence of the workmen,\r\n'b'by consulting, and recalling the models which they had seen, and by\r\n'b'emulating each other, the possessions of the colony were soon increased\r\n'b'by several baskets of different sizes. The storeroom was provided with\r\n'b'them, and in special baskets Neb placed his collection of rhizomes,\r\n'b'stone-pine almonds, etc.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the last week of the month of August the weather moderated again.\r\n'b'The temperature fell a little, and the tempest abated. The colonists\r\n'b'sallied out directly. There was certainly two feet of snow on the shore,\r\n'b'but they were able to walk without much difficulty on the hardened\r\n'b'surface. Cyrus Harding and his companions climbed Prospect Heights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What a change! The woods, which they had left green, especially in the\r\n'b'part at which the firs predominated, had disappeared under a uniform\r\n'b'color. All was white, from the summit of Mount Franklin to the shore,\r\n'b'the forests, the plains, the lake, the river. The waters of the Mercy\r\n'b'flowed under a roof of ice, which, at each rising and ebbing of the\r\n'b'tide, broke up with loud crashes. Numerous birds fluttered over the\r\n'b'frozen surface of the lake. Ducks and snipe, teal and guillemots were\r\n'b'assembled in thousands. The rocks among which the cascade flowed were\r\n'b'bristling with icicles. One might have said that the water escaped by a\r\n'b'monstrous gargoyle, shaped with all the imagination of an artist of the\r\n'b'Renaissance. As to the damage caused by the storm in the forest, that\r\n'b'could not as yet be ascertained; they would have to wait till the snowy\r\n'b'covering was dissipated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Herbert did not miss this opportunity of\r\n'b'going to visit their traps. They did not find them easily, under the\r\n'b'snow with which they were covered. They had also to be careful not to\r\n'b'fall into one or other of them, which would have been both dangerous and\r\n'b'humiliating; to be taken in their own snares! But happily they avoided\r\n'b'this unpleasantness, and found their traps perfectly intact. No animal\r\n'b'had fallen into them, and yet the footprints in the neighborhood were\r\n'b'very numerous, among others, certain very clear marks of claws. Herbert\r\n'b'did not hesitate to affirm that some animal of the feline species had\r\n'b'passed there, which justified the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s opinion that dangerous\r\n'b'beasts existed in Lincoln Island. These animals doubtless generally\r\n'b'lived in the forests of the Far West, but pressed by hunger, they had\r\n'b'ventured as far as Prospect Heights. Perhaps they had smelled out the\r\n'b'inhabitants of Granite House. \xe2\x80\x9cNow, what are these feline creatures?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' asked Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cThey are tigers,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cI thought those\r\n'b'beasts were only found in hot countries?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn the new continent,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lad, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are found from Mexico to\r\n'b'the Pampas of Buenos Aires. Now, as Lincoln Island is nearly under the\r\n'b'same latitude as the provinces of La Plata, it is not surprising that\r\n'b'tigers are to be met with in it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we must look out for them,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the snow soon disappeared, quickly dissolving under the\r\n'b'influence of the rising temperature. Rain fell, and the sheet of white\r\n'b'soon vanished. Notwithstanding the bad weather, the settlers renewed\r\n'b'their stores of different things, stone-pine almonds, rhizomes, syrup\r\n'b'from the maple-tree, for the vegetable part; rabbits from the warren,\r\n'b'agouties, and kangaroos for the animal part. This necessitated several\r\n'b'excursions into the forest, and they found that a great number of trees\r\n'b'had been blown down by the last hurricane. Pencroft and Neb also pushed\r\n'b'with the cart as far as the vein of coal, and brought back several tons\r\n'b'of fuel. They saw in passing that the pottery kiln had been severely\r\n'b'damaged by the wind, at least six feet of it having been blown off.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At the same time as the coal, the store of wood was renewed at Granite\r\n'b'House, and they profited by the current of the Mercy having again become\r\n'b'free, to float down several rafts. They could see that the cold period\r\n'b'was not ended.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A visit was also paid to the Chimneys, and the settlers could not but\r\n'b'congratulate themselves on not having been living there during the\r\n'b'hurricane. The sea had left unquestionable traces of its ravages.\r\n'b'Sweeping over the islet, it had furiously assailed the passages, half\r\n'b'filling them with sand, while thick beds of seaweed covered the rocks.\r\n'b'While Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft hunted or collected wood, Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'and Gideon Spilett busied themselves in putting the Chimneys to rights,\r\n'b'and they found the forge and the bellows almost unhurt, protected as\r\n'b'they had been from the first by the heaps of sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The store of fuel had not been made uselessly. The settlers had not done\r\n'b'with the rigorous cold. It is known that, in the Northern Hemisphere,\r\n'b'the month of February is principally distinguished by rapid fallings of\r\n'b'the temperature. It is the same in the Southern Hemisphere, and the end\r\n'b'of the month of August, which is the February of North America, does not\r\n'b'escape this climatic law.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About the 25th, after another change from snow to rain, the wind shifted\r\n'b'to the southeast, and the cold became, suddenly, very severe. According\r\n'b'to the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s calculation, the mercurial column of a Fahrenheit\r\n'b'thermometer would not have marked less than eight degrees below zero,\r\n'b'and this intense cold, rendered still more painful by a sharp gale,\r\n'b'lasted for several days. The colonists were again shut up in Granite\r\n'b'House, and as it was necessary to hermetically seal all the openings\r\n'b'of the facade, only leaving a narrow passage for renewing the air, the\r\n'b'consumption of candles was considerable. To economize them, the cavern\r\n'b'was often only lighted by the blazing hearths, on which fuel was not\r\n'b'spared. Several times, one or other of the settlers descended to the\r\n'b'beach in the midst of ice which the waves heaped up at each tide, but\r\n'b'they soon climbed up again to Granite House, and it was not without pain\r\n'b'and difficulty that their hands could hold to the rounds of the ladder.\r\n'b'In consequence of the intense cold, their fingers felt as if burned when\r\n'b'they touched the rounds. To occupy the leisure hours, which the tenants\r\n'b'of Granite House now had at their disposal, Cyrus Harding undertook an\r\n'b'operation which could be performed indoors.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'We know that the settlers had no other sugar at their disposal than\r\n'b'the liquid substance which they drew from the maple, by making deep\r\n'b'incisions in the tree. They contented themselves with collecting this\r\n'b'liquor in jars and employing it in this state for different culinary\r\n'b'purposes, and the more so, as on growing old, this liquid began to\r\n'b'become white and to be of a syrupy consistence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But there was something better to be made of it, and one day Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding announced that they were going to turn into refiners.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRefiners!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is rather a warm trade, I think.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery warm,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen it will be seasonable!\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This word refining need not awake in the mind thoughts of an elaborate\r\n'b'manufactory with apparatus and numerous workmen. No! to crystallize this\r\n'b'liquor, only an extremely easy operation is required. Placed on the fire\r\n'b'in large earthen pots, it was simply subjected to evaporation, and\r\n'b'soon a scum arose to its surface. As soon as this began to thicken,\r\n'b'Neb carefully removed it with a wooden spatula; this accelerated the\r\n'b'evaporation, and at the same time prevented it from contracting an\r\n'b'empyreumatic flavor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After boiling for several hours on a hot fire, which did as much good to\r\n'b'the operators as the substance operated upon, the latter was transformed\r\n'b'into a thick syrup. This syrup was poured into clay molds, previously\r\n'b'fabricated in the kitchen stove, and to which they had given various\r\n'b'shapes. The next day this syrup had become cold, and formed cakes\r\n'b'and tablets. This was sugar of rather a reddish color, but nearly\r\n'b'transparent and of a delicious taste.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cold continued to the middle of September, and the prisoners in\r\n'b'Granite House began to find their captivity rather tedious. Nearly every\r\n'b'day they attempted sorties which they could not prolong. They constantly\r\n'b'worked at the improvement of their dwelling. They talked while working.\r\n'b'Harding instructed his companions in many things, principally explaining\r\n'b'to them the practical applications of science. The colonists had no\r\n'b'library at their disposal; but the engineer was a book which was always\r\n'b'at hand, always open at the page which one wanted, a book which answered\r\n'b'all their questions, and which they often consulted. The time thus\r\n'b'passed away pleasantly, these brave men not appearing to have any fears\r\n'b'for the future.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, all were anxious to see, if not the fine season, at least the\r\n'b'cessation of the insupportable cold. If only they had been clothed in a\r\n'b'way to meet it, how many excursions they would have attempted, either to\r\n'b'the downs or to Tadorn\xe2\x80\x99s Fens! Game would have been easily approached,\r\n'b'and the chase would certainly have been most productive. But Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding considered it of importance that no one should injure his\r\n'b'health, for he had need of all his hands, and his advice was followed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But it must be said, that the one who was most impatient of this\r\n'b'imprisonment, after Pencroft perhaps, was Top. The faithful dog found\r\n'b'Granite House very narrow. He ran backwards and forwards from one\r\n'b'room to another, showing in his way how weary he was of being shut\r\n'b'up. Harding often remarked that when he approached the dark well which\r\n'b'communicated with the sea, and of which the orifice opened at the back\r\n'b'of the storeroom, Top uttered singular growlings. He ran round and round\r\n'b'this hole, which had been covered with a wooden lid. Sometimes even he\r\n'b'tried to put his paws under the lid, as if he wished to raise it.\r\n'b'He then yelped in a peculiar way, which showed at once anger and\r\n'b'uneasiness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer observed this maneuver several times.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What could there be in this abyss to make such an impression on the\r\n'b'intelligent animal? The well led to the sea, that was certain. Could\r\n'b'narrow passages spread from it through the foundations of the island?\r\n'b'Did some marine monster come from time to time, to breathe at the bottom\r\n'b'of this well? The engineer did not know what to think, and could not\r\n'b'refrain from dreaming of many strange improbabilities. Accustomed to go\r\n'b'far into the regions of scientific reality, he would not allow\r\n'b'himself to be drawn into the regions of the strange and almost of the\r\n'b'supernatural; but yet how to explain why Top, one of those sensible dogs\r\n'b'who never waste their time in barking at the moon, should persist in\r\n'b'trying with scent and hearing to fathom this abyss, if there was nothing\r\n'b'there to cause his uneasiness? Top\xe2\x80\x99s conduct puzzled Cyrus Harding even\r\n'b'more than he cared to acknowledge to himself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At all events, the engineer only communicated his impressions to Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, for he thought it useless to explain to his companions the\r\n'b'suspicions which arose from what perhaps was only Top\xe2\x80\x99s fancy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last the cold ceased. There had been rain, squalls mingled with snow,\r\n'b'hailstorms, gusts of wind, but these inclemencies did not last. The ice\r\n'b'melted, the snow disappeared; the shore, the plateau, the banks of\r\n'b'the Mercy, the forest, again became practicable. This return of spring\r\n'b'delighted the tenants of Granite House, and they soon only passed in it\r\n'b'the hours necessary for eating and sleeping.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They hunted much in the second part of September, which led Pencroft to\r\n'b'again entreat for the firearms, which he asserted had been promised by\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding. The latter, knowing well that without special tools it\r\n'b'would be nearly impossible for him to manufacture a gun which would be\r\n'b'of any use, still drew back and put off the operation to some future\r\n'b'time, observing in his usual dry way, that Herbert and Spilett had\r\n'b'become very skilful archers, so that many sorts of excellent animals,\r\n'b'agouties, kangaroos, capybaras, pigeons, bustards, wild ducks, snipes,\r\n'b'in short, game both with fur and feathers, fell victims to their arrows,\r\n'b'and that, consequently, they could wait. But the obstinate sailor would\r\n'b'listen to nothing of this, and he would give the engineer no peace till\r\n'b'he promised to satisfy his desire. Gideon Spilett, however, supported\r\n'b'Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf, which may be doubted,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe island is inhabited by wild\r\n'b'beasts, we must think how to fight with and exterminate them. A time may\r\n'b'come when this will be our first duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But at this period, it was not the question of firearms which occupied\r\n'b'Harding, but that of clothes. Those which the settlers wore had passed\r\n'b'this winter, but they would not last until next winter. Skins of\r\n'b'carnivora or the wool of ruminants must be procured at any price, and\r\n'b'since there were plenty of musmons, it was agreed to consult on the\r\n'b'means of forming a flock which might be brought up for the use of the\r\n'b'colony. An enclosure for the domestic animals, a poultry-yard for the\r\n'b'birds, in a word to establish a sort of farm in the island, such were\r\n'b'the two important projects for the fine season.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In consequence and in view of these future establishments, it became\r\n'b'of much importance that they should penetrate into all the yet unknown\r\n'b'parts of Lincoln Island, that is to say, through that thick forest which\r\n'b'extended on the right bank of the Mercy, from its mouth to the extremity\r\n'b'of the Serpentine Peninsula, as well as on the whole of its western\r\n'b'side. But this needed settled weather, and a month must pass before this\r\n'b'exploration could be profitably undertaken.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They therefore waited with some impatience, when an incident occurred\r\n'b'which increased the desire the settlers had to visit the whole of their\r\n'b'domain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the 24th of October. On this day, Pencroft had gone to visit his\r\n'b'traps, which he always kept properly baited. In one of them he found\r\n'b'three animals which would be very welcome for the larder. They were a\r\n'b'female peccary and her two young ones.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft then returned to Granite House, enchanted with his capture,\r\n'b'and, as usual, he made a great show of his game.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome, we shall have a grand feast, captain!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd you\r\n'b'too, Mr. Spilett, you will eat some!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI shall be very happy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what is it that I am\r\n'b'going to eat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSuckling-pig.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, indeed, suckling-pig, Pencroft? To hear you, I thought that you\r\n'b'were bringing back a young partridge stuffed with truffles!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you mean to say that you turn up your nose\r\n'b'at suckling-pig?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, without showing any enthusiasm; \xe2\x80\x9cprovided\r\n'b'one doesn\xe2\x80\x99t eat too much.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s right, that\xe2\x80\x99s right,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor, who was not pleased\r\n'b'whenever he heard his chase made light of. \xe2\x80\x9cYou like to make objections.\r\n'b'Seven months ago, when we landed on the island, you would have been only\r\n'b'too glad to have met with such game!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cman is never perfect, nor\r\n'b'contented.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI hope that Neb will distinguish himself. Look\r\n'b'here! These two little peccaries are not more than three months old!\r\n'b'They will be as tender as quails! Come along, Neb, come! I will look\r\n'b'after the cooking myself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor, followed by Neb, entered the kitchen, where they were\r\n'b'soon absorbed in their culinary labors.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were allowed to do it in their own way. Neb, therefore, prepared\r\n'b'a magnificent repast--the two little peccaries, kangaroo soup, a smoked\r\n'b'ham, stone-pine almonds, Oswego tea; in fact, all the best that they\r\n'b'had, but among all the dishes figured in the first rank the savory\r\n'b'peccaries.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock dinner was served in the dining-room of Granite House.\r\n'b'The kangaroo soup was smoking on the table. They found it excellent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To the soup succeeded the peccaries, which Pencroft insisted on carving\r\n'b'himself, and of which he served out monstrous portions to each of the\r\n'b'guests.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These suckling-pigs were really delicious, and Pencroft was devouring\r\n'b'his share with great gusto, when all at once a cry and an oath escaped\r\n'b'him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter? the matter is that I have just broken a tooth!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\n'b'sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, are there pebbles in your peccaries?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI suppose so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, drawing from his lips the object which\r\n'b'had cost him a grinder--!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was not a pebble--it was a leaden bullet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'PART 2\r\n'b'\r\n'b'ABANDONED\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 1\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now exactly seven months since the balloon voyagers had been\r\n'b'thrown on Lincoln Island. During that time, notwithstanding the\r\n'b'researches they had made, no human being had been discovered. No smoke\r\n'b'even had betrayed the presence of man on the surface of the island. No\r\n'b'vestiges of his handiwork showed that either at an early or at a late\r\n'b'period had man lived there. Not only did it now appear to be uninhabited\r\n'b'by any but themselves, but the colonists were compelled to believe that\r\n'b'it never had been inhabited. And now, all this scaffolding of reasonings\r\n'b'fell before a simple ball of metal, found in the body of an inoffensive\r\n'b'rodent! In fact, this bullet must have issued from a firearm, and who\r\n'b'but a human being could have used such a weapon?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When Pencroft had placed the bullet on the table, his companions looked\r\n'b'at it with intense astonishment. All the consequences likely to result\r\n'b'from this incident, notwithstanding its apparent insignificance,\r\n'b'immediately took possession of their minds. The sudden apparition of a\r\n'b'supernatural being could not have startled them more completely.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding did not hesitate to give utterance to the suggestions\r\n'b'which this fact, at once surprising and unexpected, could not fail to\r\n'b'raise in his mind. He took the bullet, turned it over and over, rolled\r\n'b'it between his finger and thumb; then, turning to Pencroft, he asked,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you sure that the peccary wounded by this bullet was not more than\r\n'b'three months old?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot more, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cIt was still sucking its mother\r\n'b'when I found it in the trap.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat proves that within three months a\r\n'b'gun-shot was fired in Lincoln Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that a bullet,\xe2\x80\x9d added Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cwounded, though not\r\n'b'mortally, this little animal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is unquestionable,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand these are the\r\n'b'deductions which must be drawn from this incident: that the island was\r\n'b'inhabited before our arrival, or that men have landed here within three\r\n'b'months. Did these men arrive here voluntarily or involuntarily, by\r\n'b'disembarking on the shore or by being wrecked? This point can only be\r\n'b'cleared up later. As to what they were, Europeans or Malays, enemies or\r\n'b'friends of our race, we cannot possibly guess; and if they still inhabit\r\n'b'the island, or if they have left it, we know not. But these questions\r\n'b'are of too much importance to be allowed to remain long unsettled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo! a hundred times no! a thousand times no!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor,\r\n'b'springing up from the table. \xe2\x80\x9cThere are no other men than ourselves on\r\n'b'Lincoln Island! By my faith! The island isn\xe2\x80\x99t large and if it had been\r\n'b'inhabited, we should have seen some of the inhabitants long before\r\n'b'this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn fact, the contrary would be very astonishing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut it would be much more astonishing, I should think,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\r\n'b'reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cif this peccary had been born with a bullet in its inside!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt least,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cif Pencroft has not had--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook here, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d burst out Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think I could have a\r\n'b'bullet in my jaw for five or six months without finding it out?\r\n'b'Where could it be hidden?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, opening his mouth to show the\r\n'b'two-and-thirty teeth with which it was furnished. \xe2\x80\x9cLook well, Neb, and\r\n'b'if you find one hollow tooth in this set, I will let you pull out half a\r\n'b'dozen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNeb\xe2\x80\x99s supposition is certainly inadmissible,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, who,\r\n'b'notwithstanding the gravity of his thoughts, could not restrain a smile.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is certain that a gun has been fired in the island, within three\r\n'b'months at most. But I am inclined to think that the people who landed\r\n'b'on this coast were only here a very short time ago, or that they just\r\n'b'touched here; for if, when we surveyed the island from the summit of\r\n'b'Mount Franklin, it had been inhabited, we should have seen them or we\r\n'b'should have been seen ourselves. It is therefore, probable that within\r\n'b'only a few weeks castaways have been thrown by a storm on some part of\r\n'b'the coast. However that may be, it is of consequence to us to have this\r\n'b'point settled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that we should act with caution,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSuch is my advice,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is to be feared that\r\n'b'Malay pirates have landed on the island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cwould it not be a good plan, before\r\n'b'setting out, to build a canoe in which we could either ascend the\r\n'b'river, or, if we liked, coast round the inland? It will not do to be\r\n'b'unprovided.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYour idea is good, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we cannot wait\r\n'b'for that. It would take at least a month to build a boat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a real boat,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we do not want one for a\r\n'b'sea voyage, and in five days at the most, I will undertake to construct\r\n'b'a canoe fit to navigate the Mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFive days,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cto build a boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Neb; a boat in the Indian fashion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf wood?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the Negro, looking still unconvinced.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf wood,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cor rather of bark. I repeat, captain, that\r\n'b'in five days the work will be finished!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn five days, then, be it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut till that time we must be very watchful,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery watchful indeed, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cand I beg you to\r\n'b'confine your hunting excursions to the neighborhood of Granite House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The dinner ended less gaily than Pencroft had hoped.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So, then, the island was, or had been, inhabited by others than the\r\n'b'settlers. Proved as it was by the incident of the bullet, it was\r\n'b'hereafter an unquestionable fact, and such a discovery could not but\r\n'b'cause great uneasiness among the colonists.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett, before sleeping, conversed long about\r\n'b'the matter. They asked themselves if by chance this incident might not\r\n'b'have some connection with the inexplicable way in which the engineer had\r\n'b'been saved, and the other peculiar circumstances which had struck them\r\n'b'at different times. However, Cyrus Harding, after having discussed the\r\n'b'pros and cons of the question, ended by saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn short, would you like to know my opinion, my dear Spilett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Cyrus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, it is this: however minutely we explore the island, we\r\n'b'shall find nothing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day Pencroft set to work. He did not mean to build a boat with\r\n'b'boards and planking, but simply a flat-bottomed canoe, which would be\r\n'b'well suited for navigating the Mercy--above all, for approaching its\r\n'b'source, where the water would naturally be shallow. Pieces of bark,\r\n'b'fastened one to the other, would form a light boat; and in case of\r\n'b'natural obstacles, which would render a portage necessary, it would be\r\n'b'easily carried. Pencroft intended to secure the pieces of bark by means\r\n'b'of nails, to insure the canoe being water-tight.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was first necessary to select the trees which would afford a strong\r\n'b'and supple bark for the work. Now the last storm had brought down a\r\n'b'number of large birch-trees, the bark of which would be perfectly suited\r\n'b'for their purpose. Some of these trees lay on the ground, and they had\r\n'b'only to be barked, which was the most difficult thing of all, owing to\r\n'b'the imperfect tools which the settlers possessed. However, they overcame\r\n'b'all difficulties.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While the sailor, seconded by the engineer, thus occupied himself\r\n'b'without losing an hour, Gideon Spilett and Herbert were not idle.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were made purveyors to the colony. The reporter could not but\r\n'b'admire the boy, who had acquired great skill in handling the bow and\r\n'b'spear. Herbert also showed great courage and much of that presence of\r\n'b'mind which may justly be called \xe2\x80\x9cthe reasoning of bravery.\xe2\x80\x9d These two\r\n'b'companions of the chase, remembering Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s recommendations,\r\n'b'did not go beyond a radius of two miles round Granite House; but\r\n'b'the borders of the forest furnished a sufficient tribute of agoutis,\r\n'b'capybaras, kangaroos, peccaries, etc.; and if the result from the traps\r\n'b'was less than during the cold, still the warren yielded its accustomed\r\n'b'quota, which might have fed all the colony in Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Often during these excursions, Herbert talked with Gideon Spilett on the\r\n'b'incident of the bullet, and the deductions which the engineer drew from\r\n'b'it, and one day--it was the 26th of October--he said--\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Mr. Spilett,\r\n'b'do you not think it very extraordinary that, if any castaways have\r\n'b'landed on the island, they have not yet shown themselves near Granite\r\n'b'House?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery astonishing if they are still here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut\r\n'b'not astonishing at all if they are here no longer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo you think that these people have already quitted the island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' returned Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is more than probable, my boy; for if their stay was prolonged, and\r\n'b'above all, if they were still here, some accident would have at last\r\n'b'betrayed their presence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut if they were able to go away,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the lad, \xe2\x80\x9cthey could not\r\n'b'have been castaways.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Herbert; or, at least, they were what might be called provisional\r\n'b'castaways. It is very possible that a storm may have driven them to the\r\n'b'island without destroying their vessel, and that, the storm over, they\r\n'b'went away again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI must acknowledge one thing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cit is that Captain\r\n'b'Harding appears rather to fear than desire the presence of human beings\r\n'b'on our island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn short,\xe2\x80\x9d responded the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cthere are only Malays who frequent\r\n'b'these seas, and those fellows are ruffians which it is best to avoid.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not impossible, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat some day or\r\n'b'other we may find traces of their landing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say no, my boy. A deserted camp, the ashes of a fire, would\r\n'b'put us on the track, and this is what we will look for in our next\r\n'b'expedition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The day on which the hunters spoke thus, they were in a part of the\r\n'b'forest near the Mercy, remarkable for its beautiful trees. There, among\r\n'b'others, rose, to a height of nearly 200 feet above the ground, some of\r\n'b'those superb coniferae, to which, in New Zealand, the natives give the\r\n'b'name of Kauris.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have an idea, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cIf I were to climb to the\r\n'b'top of one of these kauris, I could survey the country for an immense\r\n'b'distance round.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe idea is good,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter; \xe2\x80\x9cbut could you climb to the\r\n'b'top of those giants?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can at least try,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The light and active boy then sprang on the first branches, the\r\n'b'arrangement of which made the ascent of the kauri easy, and in a few\r\n'b'minutes he arrived at the summit, which emerged from the immense plain\r\n'b'of verdure.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From this elevated situation his gaze extended over all the southern\r\n'b'portion of the island, from Claw Cape on the southeast, to Reptile End\r\n'b'on the southwest. To the northwest rose Mount Franklin, which concealed\r\n'b'a great part of the horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But Herbert, from the height of his observatory, could examine all the\r\n'b'yet unknown portion of the island, which might have given shelter to the\r\n'b'strangers whose presence they suspected.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The lad looked attentively. There was nothing in sight on the sea, not\r\n'b'a sail, neither on the horizon nor near the island. However, as the bank\r\n'b'of trees hid the shore, it was possible that a vessel, especially if\r\n'b'deprived of her masts, might lie close to the land and thus be invisible\r\n'b'to Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neither in the forests of the Far West was anything to be seen. The wood\r\n'b'formed an impenetrable screen, measuring several square miles, without a\r\n'b'break or an opening. It was impossible even to follow the course of the\r\n'b'Mercy, or to ascertain in what part of the mountain it took its source.\r\n'b'Perhaps other creeks also ran towards the west, but they could not be\r\n'b'seen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But at last, if all indication of an encampment escaped Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s sight\r\n'b'could he not even catch a glimpse of smoke, the faintest trace of which\r\n'b'would be easily discernible in the pure atmosphere?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For an instant Herbert thought he could perceive a slight smoke in the\r\n'b'west, but a more attentive examination showed that he was mistaken. He\r\n'b'strained his eyes in every direction, and his sight was excellent. No,\r\n'b'decidedly there was nothing there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert descended to the foot of the kauri, and the two sportsmen\r\n'b'returned to Granite House. There Cyrus Harding listened to the lad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'account, shook his head and said nothing. It was very evident that\r\n'b'no decided opinion could be pronounced on this question until after a\r\n'b'complete exploration of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two days after--the 28th of October--another incident occurred, for\r\n'b'which an explanation was again required.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While strolling along the shore about two miles from Granite House,\r\n'b'Herbert and Neb were fortunate enough to capture a magnificent specimen\r\n'b'of the order of chelonia. It was a turtle of the species Midas, the\r\n'b'edible green turtle, so called from the color both of its shell and fat.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert caught sight of this turtle as it was crawling among the rocks\r\n'b'to reach the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHelp, Neb, help!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb ran up.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a fine animal!\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb; \xe2\x80\x9cbut how are we to catch it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is easier, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have only to turn the\r\n'b'turtle on its back, and it cannot possibly get away. Take your spear and\r\n'b'do as I do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reptile, aware of danger, had retired between its carapace and\r\n'b'plastron. They no longer saw its head or feet, and it was motionless as\r\n'b'a rock.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert and Neb then drove their sticks underneath the animal, and by\r\n'b'their united efforts managed without difficulty to turn it on its back.\r\n'b'The turtle, which was three feet in length, would have weighed at least\r\n'b'four hundred pounds.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCapital!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is something which will rejoice friend\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s heart.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, the heart of friend Pencroft could not fail to be rejoiced,\r\n'b'for the flesh of the turtle, which feeds on wrack-grass, is extremely\r\n'b'savory. At this moment the creature\xe2\x80\x99s head could be seen, which was\r\n'b'small, flat, but widened behind by the large temporal fossae hidden\r\n'b'under the long roof.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, what shall we do with our prize?\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb. \xe2\x80\x9cWe can\xe2\x80\x99t drag it\r\n'b'to Granite House!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLeave it here, since it cannot turn over,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\r\n'b'will come back with the cart to fetch it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the best plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, for greater precaution, Herbert took the trouble, which Neb\r\n'b'deemed superfluous, to wedge up the animal with great stones; after\r\n'b'which the two hunters returned to Granite House, following the beach,\r\n'b'which the tide had left uncovered. Herbert, wishing to surprise\r\n'b'Pencroft, said nothing about the \xe2\x80\x9csuperb specimen of a chelonian\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\n'b'they had turned over on the sand; but, two hours later, he and Neb\r\n'b'returned with the cart to the place where they had left it. The \xe2\x80\x9csuperb\r\n'b'specimen of a chelonian\xe2\x80\x9d was no longer there!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb and Herbert stared at each other first; then they stared about them.\r\n'b'It was just at this spot that the turtle had been left. The lad even\r\n'b'found the stones which he had used, and therefore he was certain of not\r\n'b'being mistaken.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cthese beasts can turn themselves over, then?\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, who could not understand it at all,\r\n'b'and was gazing at the stones scattered on the sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pencroft will be disgusted!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Captain Harding will perhaps be very perplexed how to explain this\r\n'b'disappearance,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, who wished to hide his ill-luck, \xe2\x80\x9cwe won\xe2\x80\x99t speak\r\n'b'about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn the contrary, Neb, we must speak about it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the two, taking the cart, which there was now no use for, returned\r\n'b'to Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Arrived at the dockyard, where the engineer and the sailor were working\r\n'b'together, Herbert recounted what had happened.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the stupids!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cto have let at least fifty meals\r\n'b'escape!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cit wasn\xe2\x80\x99t our fault that the beast got\r\n'b'away; as I tell you, we had turned it over on its back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen you didn\xe2\x80\x99t turn it over enough!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the obstinate sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot enough!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And he told how he had taken care to wedge up the turtle with stones.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a miracle, then!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thought, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat turtles, once placed on their\r\n'b'backs, could not regain their feet, especially when they are of a large\r\n'b'size?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen how did it manage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt what distance from the sea did you leave this turtle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\n'b'the engineer, who, having suspended his work, was reflecting on this\r\n'b'incident.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFifteen feet at the most,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the tide was low at the time?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the turtle could not do on the sand\r\n'b'it might have been able to do in the water. It turned over when the tide\r\n'b'overtook it, and then quietly returned to the deep sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh! what stupids we were!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is precisely what I had the honor of telling you before!\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\n'b'the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had given this explanation, which, no doubt, was\r\n'b'admissible. But was he himself convinced of the accuracy of this\r\n'b'explanation? It cannot be said that he was.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 2\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 9th of October the bark canoe was entirely finished. Pencroft\r\n'b'had kept his promise, and a light boat, the shell of which was joined\r\n'b'together by the flexible twigs of the crejimba, had been constructed in\r\n'b'five days. A seat in the stern, a second seat in the middle to preserve\r\n'b'the equilibrium, a third seat in the bows, rowlocks for the two oars, a\r\n'b'scull to steer with, completed the little craft, which was twelve feet\r\n'b'long, and did not weigh more than two hundred pounds. The operation of\r\n'b'launching it was extremely simple. The canoe was carried to the beach\r\n'b'and laid on the sand before Granite House, and the rising tide floated\r\n'b'it. Pencroft, who leaped in directly, maneuvered it with the scull and\r\n'b'declared it to be just the thing for the purpose to which they wished to\r\n'b'put it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor, who did not disdain to celebrate thus his\r\n'b'own triumph. \xe2\x80\x9cWith this we could go round--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe world?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, the island. Some stones for ballast, a mast and a sail, which the\r\n'b'captain will make for us some day, and we shall go splendidly! Well,\r\n'b'captain--and you, Mr. Spilett; and you, Herbert; and you, Neb--aren\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n'b'you coming to try our new vessel? Come along! we must see if it will\r\n'b'carry all five of us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was certainly a trial which ought to be made. Pencroft soon brought\r\n'b'the canoe to the shore by a narrow passage among the rocks, and it was\r\n'b'agreed that they should make a trial of the boat that day by following\r\n'b'the shore as far as the first point at which the rocks of the south\r\n'b'ended.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As they embarked, Neb cried,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut your boat leaks rather, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s nothing, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cthe wood will get seasoned.\r\n'b'In two days there won\xe2\x80\x99t be a single leak, and our boat will have no more\r\n'b'water in her than there is in the stomach of a drunkard. Jump in!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were soon all seated, and Pencroft shoved off. The weather was\r\n'b'magnificent, the sea as calm as if its waters were contained within\r\n'b'the narrow limits of a lake. Thus the boat could proceed with as much\r\n'b'security as if it was ascending the tranquil current of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb took one of the oars, Herbert the other, and Pencroft remained in\r\n'b'the stern in order to use the scull.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor first crossed the channel, and steered close to the southern\r\n'b'point of the islet. A light breeze blew from the south. No roughness was\r\n'b'found either in the channel or the green sea. A long swell, which the\r\n'b'canoe scarcely felt, as it was heavily laden, rolled regularly over the\r\n'b'surface of the water. They pulled out about half a mile distant from the\r\n'b'shore, that they might have a good view of Mount Franklin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft afterwards returned towards the mouth of the river. The boat\r\n'b'then skirted the shore, which, extending to the extreme point, hid all\r\n'b'Tadorn\xe2\x80\x99s Fens.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This point, of which the distance was increased by the irregularity of\r\n'b'the coast, was nearly three miles from the Mercy. The settlers resolved\r\n'b'to go to its extremity, and only go beyond it as much as was necessary\r\n'b'to take a rapid survey of the coast as far as Claw Cape.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The canoe followed the windings of the shore, avoiding the rocks\r\n'b'which fringed it, and which the rising tide began to cover. The cliff\r\n'b'gradually sloped away from the mouth of the river to the point. This was\r\n'b'formed of granite rocks, capriciously distributed, very different from\r\n'b'the cliff at Prospect Heights, and of an extremely wild aspect. It might\r\n'b'have been said that an immense cartload of rocks had been emptied out\r\n'b'there. There was no vegetation on this sharp promontory, which projected\r\n'b'two miles from the forest, and it thus represented a giant\xe2\x80\x99s arm\r\n'b'stretched out from a leafy sleeve.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The canoe, impelled by the two oars, advanced without difficulty. Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, pencil in one hand and notebook in the other, sketched the\r\n'b'coast in bold strokes. Neb, Herbert, and Pencroft chatted, while\r\n'b'examining this part of their domain, which was new to them, and, in\r\n'b'proportion as the canoe proceeded towards the south, the two Mandible\r\n'b'Capes appeared to move, and surround Union Bay more closely.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to Cyrus Harding, he did not speak; he simply gazed, and by the\r\n'b'mistrust which his look expressed, it appeared that he was examining\r\n'b'some strange country.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meantime, after a voyage of three-quarters of an hour, the\r\n'b'canoe reached the extremity of the point, and Pencroft was preparing to\r\n'b'return, when Herbert, rising, pointed to a black object, saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do I see down there on the beach?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All eyes turned towards the point indicated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is something. It looks like part of a\r\n'b'wreck half buried in the sand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI see what it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBarrels, barrels, which perhaps are full,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPull to the shore, Pencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few strokes of the oar brought the canoe into a little creek, and its\r\n'b'passengers leaped on shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft was not mistaken. Two barrels were there, half buried in the\r\n'b'sand, but still firmly attached to a large chest, which, sustained by\r\n'b'them, had floated to the moment when it stranded on the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere has been a wreck, then, in some part of the island,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\n'b'Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what\xe2\x80\x99s in this chest?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, with very natural\r\n'b'impatience. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s in this chest? It is shut up, and nothing to open it\r\n'b'with! Well, perhaps a stone--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor, raising a heavy block, was about to break in one of the\r\n'b'sides of the chest, when the engineer arrested his hand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you restrain your impatience for one hour\r\n'b'only?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, captain, just think! Perhaps there is everything we want in\r\n'b'there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall find that out, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cbut trust\r\n'b'to me, and do not break the chest, which may be useful to us. We must\r\n'b'convey it to Granite House, where we can open it easily, and without\r\n'b'breaking it. It is quite prepared for a voyage; and since it has floated\r\n'b'here, it may just as well float to the mouth of the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, captain, and I was wrong, as usual,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s advice was good. In fact, the canoe probably would not\r\n'b'have been able to contain the articles possibly enclosed in the chest,\r\n'b'which doubtless was heavy, since two empty barrels were required to buoy\r\n'b'it up. It was, therefore, much better to tow it to the beach at Granite\r\n'b'House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And now, whence had this chest come? That was the important question.\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions looked attentively around them, and\r\n'b'examined the shore for several hundred steps. No other articles or\r\n'b'pieces of wreck could be found. Herbert and Neb climbed a high rock\r\n'b'to survey the sea, but there was nothing in sight--neither a dismasted\r\n'b'vessel nor a ship under sail.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, there was no doubt that there had been a wreck. Perhaps this\r\n'b'incident was connected with that of the bullet? Perhaps strangers had\r\n'b'landed on another part of the island? Perhaps they were still there?\r\n'b'But the thought which came naturally to the settlers was, that these\r\n'b'strangers could not be Malay pirates, for the chest was evidently of\r\n'b'American or European make.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All the party returned to the chest, which was of an unusually large\r\n'b'size. It was made of oak wood, very carefully closed and covered with\r\n'b'a thick hide, which was secured by copper nails. The two great barrels,\r\n'b'hermetically sealed, but which sounded hollow and empty, were fastened\r\n'b'to its sides by strong ropes, knotted with a skill which Pencroft\r\n'b'directly pronounced sailors alone could exhibit. It appeared to be in a\r\n'b'perfect state of preservation, which was explained by the fact that it\r\n'b'had stranded on a sandy beach, and not among rocks. They had no doubt\r\n'b'whatever, on examining it carefully, that it had not been long in the\r\n'b'water, and that its arrival on this coast was recent. The water did\r\n'b'not appear to have penetrated to the inside, and the articles which it\r\n'b'contained were no doubt uninjured.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was evident that this chest had been thrown overboard from some\r\n'b'dismasted vessel driven towards the island, and that, in the hope\r\n'b'that it would reach the land, where they might afterwards find it,\r\n'b'the passengers had taken the precaution to buoy it up by means of this\r\n'b'floating apparatus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will tow this chest to Granite House,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwhere we\r\n'b'can make an inventory of its contents; then, if we discover any of the\r\n'b'survivors from the supposed wreck, we can return it to those to whom it\r\n'b'belongs. If we find no one--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will keep it for ourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cBut what in the world\r\n'b'can there be in it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sea was already approaching the chest, and the high tide would\r\n'b'evidently float it. One of the ropes which fastened the barrels was\r\n'b'partly unlashed and used as a cable to unite the floating apparatus with\r\n'b'the canoe. Pencroft and Neb then dug away the sand with their oars, so\r\n'b'as to facilitate the moving of the chest, towing which the boat soon\r\n'b'began to double the point, to which the name of Flotsam Point was given.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The chest was heavy, and the barrels were scarcely sufficient to keep\r\n'b'it above water. The sailor also feared every instant that it would get\r\n'b'loose and sink to the bottom of the sea. But happily his fears were not\r\n'b'realized, and an hour and a half after they set out--all that time had\r\n'b'been taken up in going a distance of three miles--the boat touched the\r\n'b'beach below Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Canoe and chest were then hauled up on the sands; and as the tide was\r\n'b'then going out, they were soon left high and dry. Neb, hurrying home,\r\n'b'brought back some tools with which to open the chest in such a way that\r\n'b'it might be injured as little as possible, and they proceeded to its\r\n'b'inventory. Pencroft did not try to hide that he was greatly excited.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor began by detaching the two barrels, which, being in good\r\n'b'condition, would of course be of use. Then the locks were forced with a\r\n'b'cold chisel and hammer, and the lid thrown back. A second casing of zinc\r\n'b'lined the interior of the chest, which had been evidently arranged\r\n'b'that the articles which it enclosed might under any circumstances be\r\n'b'sheltered from damp.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose it\xe2\x80\x99s jam!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hope not,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf only there was--\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor in a low voice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb, who overheard him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The covering of zinc was torn off and thrown back over the sides of the\r\n'b'chest, and by degrees numerous articles of very varied character were\r\n'b'produced and strewn about on the sand. At each new object Pencroft\r\n'b'uttered fresh hurrahs, Herbert clapped his hands, and Neb danced up and\r\n'b'down. There were books which made Herbert wild with joy, and cooking\r\n'b'utensils which Neb covered with kisses!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In short, the colonists had reason to be extremely satisfied, for this\r\n'b'chest contained tools, weapons, instruments, clothes, books; and this\r\n'b'is the exact list of them as stated in Gideon Spilett\xe2\x80\x99s note-book:\r\n'b'--Tools:--3 knives with several blades, 2 woodmen\xe2\x80\x99s axes, 2 carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'hatchets, 3 planes, 2 adzes, 1 twibil or mattock, 6 chisels, 2 files,\r\n'b'3 hammers, 3 gimlets, 2 augers, 10 bags of nails and screws, 3 saws of\r\n'b'different sizes, 2 boxes of needles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Weapons:--2 flint-lock guns, 2 for percussion caps, 2 breach-loader\r\n'b'carbines, 5 boarding cutlasses, 4 sabers, 2 barrels of powder, each\r\n'b'containing twenty-five pounds; 12 boxes of percussion caps.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Instruments:--1 sextant, 1 double opera-glass, 1 telescope, 1 box of\r\n'b'mathematical instruments, 1 mariner\xe2\x80\x99s compass, 1 Fahrenheit thermometer,\r\n'b'1 aneroid barometer, 1 box containing a photographic apparatus,\r\n'b'object-glass, plates, chemicals, etc.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Clothes:--2 dozen shirts of a peculiar material resembling wool, but\r\n'b'evidently of a vegetable origin; 3 dozen stockings of the same material.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Utensils:--1 iron pot, 6 copper saucepans, 3 iron dishes, 10 metal\r\n'b'plates, 2 kettles, 1 portable stove, 6 table-knives.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Books:--1 Bible, 1 atlas, 1 dictionary of the different Polynesian\r\n'b'idioms, 1 dictionary of natural science, in six volumes; 3 reams of\r\n'b'white paper, 2 books with blank pages.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be allowed,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, after the inventory had been\r\n'b'made, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the owner of this chest was a practical man! Tools, weapons,\r\n'b'instruments, clothes, utensils, books--nothing is wanting! It might\r\n'b'really be said that he expected to be wrecked, and had prepared for it\r\n'b'beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing is wanting, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd for a certainty,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthe vessel which carried this\r\n'b'chest and its owner was not a Malay pirate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthe owner had been taken prisoner by\r\n'b'pirates--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not admissible,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is more probable\r\n'b'that an American or European vessel has been driven into this quarter,\r\n'b'and that her passengers, wishing to save necessaries at least, prepared\r\n'b'this chest and threw it overboard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your opinion, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat may have been the case. It\r\n'b'is possible that at the moment, or in expectation of a wreck, they\r\n'b'collected into this chest different articles of the greatest use in\r\n'b'hopes of finding it again on the coast--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven the photographic box!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor incredulously.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs to that apparatus,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cI do not quite see the use of\r\n'b'it; and a more complete supply of clothes or more abundant ammunition\r\n'b'would have been more valuable to us as well as to any other castaways!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut isn\xe2\x80\x99t there any mark or direction on these instruments, tools, or\r\n'b'books, which would tell us something about them?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That might be ascertained. Each article was carefully examined,\r\n'b'especially the books, instruments and weapons. Neither the weapons nor\r\n'b'the instruments, contrary to the usual custom, bore the name of the\r\n'b'maker; they were, besides, in a perfect state, and did not appear to\r\n'b'have been used. The same peculiarity marked the tools and utensils; all\r\n'b'were new, which proved that the articles had not been taken by chance\r\n'b'and thrown into the chest, but, on the contrary, that the choice of\r\n'b'things had been well considered and arranged with care. This was also\r\n'b'indicated by the second case of metal which had preserved them from\r\n'b'damp, and which could not have been soldered in a moment of haste.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the dictionaries of natural science and Polynesian idioms, both\r\n'b'were English; but they neither bore the name of the publisher nor the\r\n'b'date of publication.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The same with the Bible printed in English, in quarto, remarkable from a\r\n'b'typographic point of view, and which appeared to have been often used.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The atlas was a magnificent work, comprising maps of every country in\r\n'b'the world, and several planispheres arranged upon Mercator\xe2\x80\x99s projection,\r\n'b'and of which the nomenclature was in French--but which also bore neither\r\n'b'date nor name of publisher.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was nothing, therefore, on these different articles by which\r\n'b'they could be traced, and nothing consequently of a nature to show the\r\n'b'nationality of the vessel which must have recently passed these shores.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But, wherever the chest might have come from, it was a treasure to the\r\n'b'settlers on Lincoln Island. Till then, by making use of the productions\r\n'b'of nature, they had created everything for themselves, and, thanks to\r\n'b'their intelligence, they had managed without difficulty. But did it not\r\n'b'appear as if Providence had wished to reward them by sending them these\r\n'b'productions of human industry? Their thanks rose unanimously to Heaven.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, one of them was not quite satisfied: it was Pencroft. It\r\n'b'appeared that the chest did not contain something which he evidently\r\n'b'held in great esteem, for in proportion as they approached the bottom\r\n'b'of the box, his hurrahs diminished in heartiness, and, the inventory\r\n'b'finished, he was heard to mutter these words:--\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s all very fine,\r\n'b'but you can see that there is nothing for me in that box!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This led Neb to say,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, friend Pencroft, what more do you expect?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHalf a pound of tobacco,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft seriously, \xe2\x80\x9cand nothing\r\n'b'would have been wanting to complete my happiness!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No one could help laughing at this speech of the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the result of this discovery of the chest was, that it was now more\r\n'b'than ever necessary to explore the island thoroughly. It was therefore\r\n'b'agreed that the next morning at break of day, they should set out, by\r\n'b'ascending the Mercy so as to reach the western shore. If any castaways\r\n'b'had landed on the coast, it was to be feared they were without\r\n'b'resources, and it was therefore the more necessary to carry help to them\r\n'b'without delay.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the day the different articles were carried to Granite House,\r\n'b'where they were methodically arranged in the great hall. This day--the\r\n'b'29th of October--happened to be a Sunday, and, before going to bed,\r\n'b'Herbert asked the engineer if he would not read them something from the\r\n'b'Gospel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWillingly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He took the sacred volume, and was about to open it, when Pencroft\r\n'b'stopped him, saying,--\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, I am superstitious. Open at random\r\n'b'and read the first verse which, your eye falls upon. We will see if it\r\n'b'applies to our situation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding smiled at the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s idea, and, yielding to his wish, he\r\n'b'opened exactly at a place where the leaves were separated by a marker.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Immediately his eyes were attracted by a cross which, made with a\r\n'b'pencil, was placed against the eighth verse of the seventh chapter of\r\n'b'the Gospel of St. Matthew. He read the verse, which was this:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor every one that asketh receiveth; and he that seeketh findeth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 3\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 30th of October, all was ready for the proposed\r\n'b'exploring expedition, which recent events had rendered so necessary. In\r\n'b'fact, things had so come about that the settlers in Lincoln Island no\r\n'b'longer needed help for themselves, but were even able to carry it to\r\n'b'others.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was therefore agreed that they should ascend the Mercy as far as\r\n'b'the river was navigable. A great part of the distance would thus be\r\n'b'traversed without fatigue, and the explorers could transport their\r\n'b'provisions and arms to an advanced point in the west of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was necessary to think not only of the things which they should take\r\n'b'with them, but also of those which they might have by chance to bring\r\n'b'back to Granite House. If there had been a wreck on the coast, as was\r\n'b'supposed, there would be many things cast up, which would be lawfully\r\n'b'their prizes. In the event of this, the cart would have been of more use\r\n'b'than the light canoe, but it was heavy and clumsy to drag, and therefore\r\n'b'more difficult to use; this led Pencroft to express his regret that the\r\n'b'chest had not contained, besides \xe2\x80\x9chis halfpound of tobacco,\xe2\x80\x9d a pair\r\n'b'of strong New Jersey horses, which would have been very useful to the\r\n'b'colony!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The provisions, which Neb had already packed up, consisted of a store\r\n'b'of meat and of several gallons of beer, that is to say enough to sustain\r\n'b'them for three days, the time which Harding assigned for the expedition.\r\n'b'They hoped besides to supply themselves on the road, and Neb took care\r\n'b'not to forget the portable stove.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The only tools the settlers took were the two woodmen\xe2\x80\x99s axes, which\r\n'b'they could use to cut a path through the thick forests, as also the\r\n'b'instruments, the telescope and pocket-compass.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For weapons they selected the two flint-lock guns, which were likely\r\n'b'to be more useful to them than the percussion fowling-pieces, the first\r\n'b'only requiring flints which could be easily replaced, and the latter\r\n'b'needing fulminating caps, a frequent use of which would soon exhaust\r\n'b'their limited stock. However, they took also one of the carbines and\r\n'b'some cartridges. As to the powder, of which there was about fifty pounds\r\n'b'in the barrel, a small supply of it had to be taken, but the engineer\r\n'b'hoped to manufacture an explosive substance which would allow them to\r\n'b'husband it. To the firearms were added the five cutlasses well sheathed\r\n'b'in leather, and, thus supplied, the settlers could venture into the vast\r\n'b'forest with some chance of success.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is useless to add that Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb, thus armed, were\r\n'b'at the summit of their happiness, although Cyrus Harding made them\r\n'b'promise not to fire a shot unless it was necessary.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At six in the morning the canoe put off from the shore; all had\r\n'b'embarked, including Top, and they proceeded to the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The tide had begun to come up half an hour before. For several hours,\r\n'b'therefore, there would be a current, which it was well to profit by, for\r\n'b'later the ebb would make it difficult to ascend the river. The tide was\r\n'b'already strong, for in three days the moon would be full, and it was\r\n'b'enough to keep the boat in the center of the current, where it floated\r\n'b'swiftly along between the high banks without its being necessary\r\n'b'to increase its speed by the aid of the oars. In a few minutes the\r\n'b'explorers arrived at the angle formed by the Mercy and exactly at the\r\n'b'place where, seven months before, Pencroft had made his first raft of\r\n'b'wood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After this sudden angle the river widened and flowed under the shade of\r\n'b'great evergreen firs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The aspect of the banks was magnificent. Cyrus Harding and his\r\n'b'companions could not but admire the lovely effects so easily produced\r\n'b'by nature with water and trees. As they advanced the forest element\r\n'b'diminished. On the right bank of the river grew magnificent specimens of\r\n'b'the ulmaceae tribe, the precious elm, so valuable to builders, and which\r\n'b'withstands well the action of water. Then there were numerous groups\r\n'b'belonging to the same family, among others one in particular, the fruit\r\n'b'of which produces a very useful oil. Further on, Herbert remarked the\r\n'b'lardizabala, a twining shrub which, when bruised in water, furnishes\r\n'b'excellent cordage; and two or three ebony trees of a beautiful black,\r\n'b'crossed with capricious veins.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From time to time, in certain places where the landing was easy, the\r\n'b'canoe was stopped, when Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft, their\r\n'b'guns in their hands, and preceded by Top, jumped on shore. Without\r\n'b'expecting game, some useful plant might be met with, and the young\r\n'b'naturalist was delighted with discovering a sort of wild spinach,\r\n'b'belonging to the order of chenopodiaceae, and numerous specimens of\r\n'b'cruciferae, belonging to the cabbage tribe, which it would certainly be\r\n'b'possible to cultivate by transplanting. There were cresses, horseradish,\r\n'b'turnips, and lastly, little branching hairy stalks, scarcely more than\r\n'b'three feet high, which produced brownish grains.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know what this plant is?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert of the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTobacco!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, who evidently had never seen his favorite\r\n'b'plant except in the bowl of his pipe.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is not tobacco, it is mustard.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMustard be hanged!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut if by chance you happen\r\n'b'to come across a tobacco-plant, my boy, pray don\xe2\x80\x99t scorn that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall find it some day!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen that day comes, I do not know what\r\n'b'more will be wanting in our island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These different plants, which had been carefully rooted up, were carried\r\n'b'to the canoe, where Cyrus Harding had remained buried in thought.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft in this manner frequently\r\n'b'disembarked, sometimes on the right bank, sometimes on the left bank of\r\n'b'the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The latter was less abrupt, but the former more wooded. The engineer\r\n'b'ascertained by consulting his pocket-compass that the direction of the\r\n'b'river from the first turn was obviously southwest and northeast, and\r\n'b'nearly straight for a length of about three miles. But it was to be\r\n'b'supposed that this direction changed beyond that point, and that the\r\n'b'Mercy continued to the north-west, towards the spurs of Mount Franklin,\r\n'b'among which the river rose.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During one of these excursions, Gideon Spilett managed to get hold\r\n'b'of two couples of living gallinaceae. They were birds with long, thin\r\n'b'beaks, lengthened necks, short wings, and without any appearance of\r\n'b'a tail. Herbert rightly gave them the name of tinamous, and it\r\n'b'was resolved that they should be the first tenants of their future\r\n'b'poultry-yard.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But till then the guns had not spoken, and the first report which awoke\r\n'b'the echoes of the forest of the Far West was provoked by the appearance\r\n'b'of a beautiful bird, resembling the kingfisher.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI recognize him!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, and it seemed as if his gun went off\r\n'b'by itself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you recognize?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe bird which escaped us on our first excursion, and from which we\r\n'b'gave the name to that part of the forest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA jacamar!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was indeed a jacamar, of which the plumage shines with a metallic\r\n'b'luster. A shot brought it to the ground, and Top carried it to the\r\n'b'canoe. At the same time half a dozen lories were brought down. The lory\r\n'b'is of the size of a pigeon, the plumage dashed with green, part of\r\n'b'the wings crimson, and its crest bordered with white. To the young boy\r\n'b'belonged the honor of this shot, and he was proud enough of it. Lories\r\n'b'are better food than the jacamar, the flesh of which is rather tough,\r\n'b'but it was difficult to persuade Pencroft that he had not killed the\r\n'b'king of eatable birds. It was ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning when the canoe\r\n'b'reached a second angle of the Mercy, nearly five miles from its mouth.\r\n'b'Here a halt was made for breakfast under the shade of some splendid\r\n'b'trees. The river still measured from sixty to seventy feet in breadth,\r\n'b'and its bed from five to six feet in depth. The engineer had observed\r\n'b'that it was increased by numerous affluents, but they were unnavigable,\r\n'b'being simply little streams. As to the forest, including Jacamar Wood,\r\n'b'as well as the forests of the Far West, it extended as far as the eye\r\n'b'could reach. In no place, either in the depths of the forests or under\r\n'b'the trees on the banks of the Mercy, was the presence of man revealed.\r\n'b'The explorers could not discover one suspicious trace. It was evident\r\n'b'that the woodman\xe2\x80\x99s axe had never touched these trees, that the pioneer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'knife had never severed the creepers hanging from one trunk to another\r\n'b'in the midst of tangled brushwood and long grass. If castaways had\r\n'b'landed on the island, they could not have yet quitted the shore, and it\r\n'b'was not in the woods that the survivors of the supposed shipwreck should\r\n'b'be sought.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer therefore manifested some impatience to reach the western\r\n'b'coast of Lincoln Island, which was at least five miles distant according\r\n'b'to his estimation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The voyage was continued, and as the Mercy appeared to flow not towards\r\n'b'the shore, but rather towards Mount Franklin, it was decided that they\r\n'b'should use the boat as long as there was enough water under its keel\r\n'b'to float it. It was both fatigue spared and time gained, for they would\r\n'b'have been obliged to cut a path through the thick wood with their axes.\r\n'b'But soon the flow completely failed them, either the tide was going\r\n'b'down, and it was about the hour, or it could no longer be felt at this\r\n'b'distance from the mouth of the Mercy. They had therefore to make use of\r\n'b'the oars. Herbert and Neb each took one, and Pencroft took the scull.\r\n'b'The forest soon became less dense, the trees grew further apart and\r\n'b'often quite isolated. But the further they were from each other the more\r\n'b'magnificent they appeared, profiting, as they did, by the free, pure air\r\n'b'which circulated around them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What splendid specimens of the flora of this latitude! Certainly\r\n'b'their presence would have been enough for a botanist to name without\r\n'b'hesitation the parallel which traversed Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEucalypti!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were, in fact, those splendid trees, the giants of the\r\n'b'extratropical zone, the congeners of the Australian and New Zealand\r\n'b'eucalyptus, both situated under the same latitude as Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'Some rose to a height of two hundred feet. Their trunks at the base\r\n'b'measured twenty feet in circumference, and their bark was covered by a\r\n'b'network of farrows containing a red, sweet-smelling gum. Nothing is more\r\n'b'wonderful or more singular than those enormous specimens of the order of\r\n'b'the myrtaceae, with their leaves placed vertically and not horizontally,\r\n'b'so that an edge and not a surface looks upwards, the effect being that\r\n'b'the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays penetrate more freely among the trees.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The ground at the foot of the eucalypti was carpeted with grass, and\r\n'b'from the bushes escaped flights of little birds, which glittered in the\r\n'b'sunlight like winged rubies.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese are something like trees!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb; \xe2\x80\x9cbut are they good for\r\n'b'anything?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPooh!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cOf course there are vegetable giants as well\r\n'b'as human giants, and they are no good, except to show themselves at\r\n'b'fairs!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that you are mistaken, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\n'b'that the wood of the eucalyptus has begun to be very advantageously\r\n'b'employed in cabinet-making.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I may add,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the eucalyptus belongs to a family\r\n'b'which comprises many useful members; the guava-tree, from whose fruit\r\n'b'guava jelly is made; the clove-tree, which produces the spice; the\r\n'b'pomegranate-tree, which bears pomegranates; the Eugeacia Cauliflora,\r\n'b'the fruit of which is used in making a tolerable wine; the Ugui myrtle,\r\n'b'which contains an excellent alcoholic liquor; the Caryophyllus myrtle,\r\n'b'of which the bark forms an esteemed cinnamon; the Eugenia Pimenta, from\r\n'b'whence comes Jamaica pepper; the common myrtle, from whose buds and\r\n'b'berries spice is sometimes made; the Eucalyptus manifera, which yields\r\n'b'a sweet sort of manna; the Guinea Eucalyptus, the sap of which is\r\n'b'transformed into beer by fermentation; in short, all those trees known\r\n'b'under the name of gum-trees or iron-bark trees in Australia, belong\r\n'b'to this family of the myrtaceae, which contains forty-six genera and\r\n'b'thirteen hundred species!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The lad was allowed to run on, and he delivered his little botanical\r\n'b'lecture with great animation. Cyrus Harding listened smiling, and\r\n'b'Pencroft with an indescribable feeling of pride.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery good, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I could swear that all\r\n'b'those useful specimens you have just told us about are none of them\r\n'b'giants like these!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat supports what I said,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cnamely, that these\r\n'b'giants are good for nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere you are wrong, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cthese gigantic\r\n'b'eucalypti, which shelter us, are good for something.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo render the countries which they inhabit healthy. Do you know what\r\n'b'they are called in Australia and New Zealand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are called \xe2\x80\x98fever trees.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they give fevers?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, because they prevent them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood. I must note that,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNote it then, my dear Spilett; for it appears proved that the presence\r\n'b'of the eucalyptus is enough to neutralize miasmas. This natural antidote\r\n'b'has been tried in certain countries in the middle of Europe and the\r\n'b'north of Africa where the soil was absolutely unhealthy, and the\r\n'b'sanitary condition of the inhabitants has been gradually ameliorated. No\r\n'b'more intermittent fevers prevail in the regions now covered with forests\r\n'b'of the myrtaceae. This fact is now beyond doubt, and it is a happy\r\n'b'circumstance for us settlers in Lincoln Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh! what an island! What a blessed island!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cI tell\r\n'b'you, it wants nothing--unless it is--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat will come, Pencroft, that will be found,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer;\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cbut now we must continue our voyage and push on as far as the river\r\n'b'will carry our boat!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The exploration was therefore continued for another two miles in the\r\n'b'midst of country covered with eucalypti, which predominated in the woods\r\n'b'of this portion of the island. The space which they occupied extended as\r\n'b'far as the eye could reach on each side of the Mercy, which wound along\r\n'b'between high green banks. The bed was often obstructed by long weeds,\r\n'b'and even by pointed rocks, which rendered the navigation very difficult.\r\n'b'The action of the oars was prevented, and Pencroft was obliged to push\r\n'b'with a pole. They found also that the water was becoming shallower\r\n'b'and shallower, and that the canoe must soon stop. The sun was already\r\n'b'sinking towards the horizon, and the trees threw long shadows on the\r\n'b'ground. Cyrus Harding, seeing that he could not hope to reach the\r\n'b'western coast of the island in one journey, resolved to camp at the\r\n'b'place where any further navigation was prevented by want of water. He\r\n'b'calculated that they were still five or six miles from the coast, and\r\n'b'this distance was too great for them to attempt during the night in the\r\n'b'midst of unknown woods.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The boat was pushed on through the forest, which gradually became\r\n'b'thicker again, and appeared also to have more inhabitants; for if the\r\n'b'eyes of the sailor did not deceive him, he thought he saw bands of\r\n'b'monkeys springing among the trees. Sometimes even two or three of these\r\n'b'animals stopped at a little distance from the canoe and gazed at the\r\n'b'settlers without manifesting any terror, as if, seeing men for the first\r\n'b'time, they had not yet learned to fear them. It would have been easy\r\n'b'to bring down one of these quadramani with a gunshot, and Pencroft was\r\n'b'greatly tempted to fire, but Harding opposed so useless a massacre.\r\n'b'This was prudent, for the monkeys, or apes rather, appearing to be very\r\n'b'powerful and extremely active, it was useless to provoke an unnecessary\r\n'b'aggression, and the creatures might, ignorant of the power of the\r\n'b'explorers\xe2\x80\x99 firearms, have attacked them. It is true that the sailor\r\n'b'considered the monkeys from a purely alimentary point of view, for those\r\n'b'animals which are herbivorous make very excellent game; but since they\r\n'b'had an abundant supply of provisions, it was a pity to waste their\r\n'b'ammunition.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the navigation of the Mercy became exceedingly\r\n'b'difficult, for its course was obstructed by aquatic plants and rocks.\r\n'b'The banks rose higher and higher, and already they were approaching the\r\n'b'spurs of Mount Franklin. The source could not be far off, since it was\r\n'b'fed by the water from the southern slopes of the mountain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a quarter of an hour,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall be obliged to\r\n'b'stop, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, we will stop, Pencroft, and we will make our encampment for\r\n'b'the night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt what distance are we from Granite House?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout seven miles,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9ctaking into calculation,\r\n'b'however, the detours of the river, which has carried us to the\r\n'b'northwest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShall we go on?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, as long as we can,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, at break of\r\n'b'day, we will leave the canoe, and in two hours I hope we shall cross the\r\n'b'distance which separates us from the coast, and then we shall have the\r\n'b'whole day in which to explore the shore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGo ahead!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But soon the boat grated on the stony bottom of the river, which was\r\n'b'now not more than twenty feet in breadth. The trees met like a bower\r\n'b'overhead, and caused a half-darkness. They also heard the noise of a\r\n'b'waterfall, which showed that a few hundred feet up the river there was a\r\n'b'natural barrier.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Presently, after a sudden turn of the river, a cascade appeared through\r\n'b'the trees. The canoe again touched the bottom, and in a few minutes it\r\n'b'was moored to a trunk near the right bank.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was nearly five o\xe2\x80\x99clock. The last rays of the sun gleamed through\r\n'b'the thick foliage and glanced on the little waterfall, making the spray\r\n'b'sparkle with all the colors of the rainbow. Beyond that, the Mercy was\r\n'b'lost in the bushwood, where it was fed from some hidden source. The\r\n'b'different streams which flowed into it increased it to a regular river\r\n'b'further down, but here it was simply a shallow, limpid brook.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was agreed to camp here, as the place was charming. The colonists\r\n'b'disembarked, and a fire was soon lighted under a clump of trees, among\r\n'b'the branches of which Cyrus Harding and his companions could, if it was\r\n'b'necessary, take refuge for the night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Supper was quickly devoured, for they were very hungry, and then there\r\n'b'was only sleeping to think of. But, as roarings of rather a suspicious\r\n'b'nature had been heard during the evening, a good fire was made up for\r\n'b'the night, so as to protect the sleepers with its crackling flames. Neb\r\n'b'and Pencroft also watched by turns, and did not spare fuel. They thought\r\n'b'they saw the dark forms of some wild animals prowling round the camp\r\n'b'among the bushes, but the night passed without incident, and the next\r\n'b'day, the 31st of October, at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, all were on\r\n'b'foot, ready for a start.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 4\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was six o\xe2\x80\x99 clock in the morning when the settlers, after a hasty\r\n'b'breakfast, set out to reach by the shortest way, the western coast of\r\n'b'the island. And how long would it take to do this? Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'had said two hours, but of course that depended on the nature of the\r\n'b'obstacles they might meet with. As it was probable that they would have\r\n'b'to cut a path through the grass, shrubs, and creepers, they marched axe\r\n'b'in hand, and with guns also ready, wisely taking warning from the cries\r\n'b'of the wild beasts heard in the night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The exact position of the encampment could be determined by the bearing\r\n'b'of Mount Franklin, and as the volcano arose in the north at a distance\r\n'b'of less than three miles, they had only to go straight towards the\r\n'b'southwest to reach the western coast. They set out, having first\r\n'b'carefully secured the canoe. Pencroft and Neb carried sufficient\r\n'b'provision for the little band for at least two days. It would not thus\r\n'b'be necessary to hunt. The engineer advised his companions to refrain\r\n'b'from firing, that their presence might not be betrayed to any one near\r\n'b'the shore. The first hatchet blows were given among the brushwood in the\r\n'b'midst of some mastic-trees, a little above the cascade; and his compass\r\n'b'in his hand, Cyrus Harding led the way.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The forest here was composed for the most part of trees which had\r\n'b'already been met with near the lake and on Prospect Heights. There\r\n'b'were deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, gum trees, eucalypti, hibiscus,\r\n'b'cedars, and other trees, generally of a moderate size, for their number\r\n'b'prevented their growth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Since their departure, the settlers had descended the slopes which\r\n'b'constituted the mountain system of the island, on to a dry soil, but the\r\n'b'luxuriant vegetation of which indicated it to be watered either by some\r\n'b'subterranean marsh or by some stream. However, Cyrus Harding did not\r\n'b'remember having seen, at the time of his excursion to the crater, any\r\n'b'other watercourses but the Red Creek and the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the first part of their excursion, they saw numerous troops of\r\n'b'monkeys who exhibited great astonishment at the sight of men, whose\r\n'b'appearance was so new to them. Gideon Spilett jokingly asked whether\r\n'b'these active and merry quadrupeds did not consider him and his\r\n'b'companions as degenerate brothers.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And certainly, pedestrians, hindered at each step by bushes, caught by\r\n'b'creepers, barred by trunks of trees, did not shine beside those supple\r\n'b'animals, who, bounding from branch to branch, were hindered by nothing\r\n'b'on their course. The monkeys were numerous, but happily they did not\r\n'b'manifest any hostile disposition.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Several pigs, agoutis, kangaroos, and other rodents were seen, also two\r\n'b'or three koalas, at which Pencroft longed to have a shot.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cyou may jump and play just now; we shall have one or\r\n'b'two words to say to you on our way back!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At half-past nine the way was suddenly found to be barred by an unknown\r\n'b'stream, from thirty to forty feet broad, whose rapid current dashed\r\n'b'foaming over the numerous rocks which interrupted its course. This creek\r\n'b'was deep and clear, but it was absolutely unnavigable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are cut off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cit is only a stream, and we can easily swim\r\n'b'over.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would be the use of that?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cThis creek evidently\r\n'b'runs to the sea. Let us remain on this side and follow the bank, and\r\n'b'I shall be much astonished if it does not lead us very quickly to the\r\n'b'coast. Forward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne minute,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe name of this creek, my friends? Do\r\n'b'not let us leave our geography incomplete.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll right!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cName it, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, addressing the lad.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWill it not be better to wait until we have explored it to its mouth?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' answered Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cLet us follow it as fast as we can\r\n'b'without stopping.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStill another minute!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThough hunting is forbidden, fishing is allowed, I suppose,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\n'b'sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have no time to lose,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh! five minutes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI only ask for five minutes to\r\n'b'use in the interest of our breakfast!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Pencroft, lying down on the bank, plunged his arm into the water,\r\n'b'and soon pulled up several dozen of fine crayfish from among the stones.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese will be good!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb, going to the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s aid.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs I said, there is everything in this island, except tobacco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' muttered Pencroft with a sigh.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The fishing did not take five minutes, for the crayfish were swarming in\r\n'b'the creek. A bag was filled with the crustaceae, whose shells were of a\r\n'b'cobalt blue. The settlers then pushed on.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They advanced more rapidly and easily along the bank of the river than\r\n'b'in the forest. From time to time they came upon the traces of animals of\r\n'b'a large size who had come to quench their thirst at the stream, but none\r\n'b'were actually seen, and it was evidently not in this part of the forest\r\n'b'that the peccary had received the bullet which had cost Pencroft a\r\n'b'grinder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, considering the rapid current, Harding was led to\r\n'b'suppose that he and his companions were much farther from the western\r\n'b'coast than they had at first supposed. In fact, at this hour, the rising\r\n'b'tide would have turned back the current of the creek, if its mouth had\r\n'b'only been a few miles distant. Now, this effect was not produced, and\r\n'b'the water pursued its natural course. The engineer was much astonished\r\n'b'at this, and frequently consulted his compass, to assure himself that\r\n'b'some turn of the river was not leading them again into the Far West.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the creek gradually widened and its waters became less\r\n'b'tumultuous. The trees on the right bank were as close together as on the\r\n'b'left bank, and it was impossible to distinguish anything beyond them;\r\n'b'but these masses of wood were evidently uninhabited, for Top did not\r\n'b'bark, and the intelligent animal would not have failed to signal the\r\n'b'presence of any stranger in the neighborhood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At half-past ten, to the great surprise of Cyrus Harding, Herbert, who\r\n'b'was a little in front, suddenly stopped and exclaimed,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe sea!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few minutes more, the whole western shore of the island lay\r\n'b'extended before the eyes of the settlers.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But what a contrast between this and the eastern coast, upon which\r\n'b'chance had first thrown them. No granite cliff, no rocks, not even a\r\n'b'sandy beach. The forest reached the shore, and the tall trees bending\r\n'b'over the water were beaten by the waves. It was not such a shore as is\r\n'b'usually formed by nature, either by extending a vast carpet of sand,\r\n'b'or by grouping masses of rock, but a beautiful border consisting of the\r\n'b'most splendid trees. The bank was raised a little above the level of the\r\n'b'sea, and on this luxuriant soil, supported by a granite base, the fine\r\n'b'forest trees seemed to be as firmly planted as in the interior of the\r\n'b'island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists were then on the shore of an unimportant little harbor,\r\n'b'which would scarcely have contained even two or three fishing-boats. It\r\n'b'served as a neck to the new creek, of which the curious thing was that\r\n'b'its waters, instead of joining the sea by a gentle slope, fell from a\r\n'b'height of more than forty feet, which explained why the rising tide was\r\n'b'not felt up the stream. In fact, the tides of the Pacific, even at\r\n'b'their maximum elevation, could never reach the level of the river, and,\r\n'b'doubtless, millions of years would pass before the water would have worn\r\n'b'away the granite and hollowed a practicable mouth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was settled that the name of Falls River should be given to this\r\n'b'stream. Beyond, towards the north, the forest border was prolonged for\r\n'b'a space of nearly two miles; then the trees became scarcer, and beyond\r\n'b'that again the picturesque heights described a nearly straight line,\r\n'b'which ran north and south. On the contrary, all the part of the shore\r\n'b'between Falls River and Reptile End was a mass of wood, magnificent\r\n'b'trees, some straight, others bent, so that the long sea-swell bathed\r\n'b'their roots. Now, it was this coast, that is, all the Serpentine\r\n'b'Peninsula, that was to be explored, for this part of the shore offered\r\n'b'a refuge to castaways, which the other wild and barren side must have\r\n'b'refused.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The weather was fine and clear, and from a height of a hillock on which\r\n'b'Neb and Pencroft had arranged breakfast, a wide view was obtained. There\r\n'b'was, however, not a sail in sight; nothing could be seen along the shore\r\n'b'as far as the eye could reach. But the engineer would take nothing for\r\n'b'granted until he had explored the coast to the very extremity of the\r\n'b'Serpentine Peninsula.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Breakfast was soon despatched, and at half-past eleven the captain gave\r\n'b'the signal for departure. Instead of proceeding over the summit of a\r\n'b'cliff or along a sandy beach, the settlers were obliged to remain under\r\n'b'cover of the trees so that they might continue on the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The distance which separated Falls River from Reptile End was about\r\n'b'twelve miles. It would have taken the settlers four hours to do this,\r\n'b'on a clear ground and without hurrying themselves; but as it was they\r\n'b'needed double the time, for what with trees to go round, bushes to cut\r\n'b'down, and creepers to chop away, they were impeded at every step, these\r\n'b'obstacles greatly lengthening their journey.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was, however, nothing to show that a shipwreck had taken place\r\n'b'recently. It is true that, as Gideon Spilett observed, any remains of\r\n'b'it might have drifted out to sea, and they must not take it for granted\r\n'b'that because they could find no traces of it, a ship had not been\r\n'b'castaway on the coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter\xe2\x80\x99s argument was just, and besides, the incident of the\r\n'b'bullet proved that a shot must have been fired in Lincoln Island within\r\n'b'three months.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was already five o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and there were still two miles between the\r\n'b'settlers and the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula. It was evident\r\n'b'that after having reached Reptile End, Harding and his companions would\r\n'b'not have time to return before dark to their encampment near the source\r\n'b'of the Mercy. It would therefore be necessary to pass the night on the\r\n'b'promontory. But they had no lack of provisions, which was lucky, for\r\n'b'there were no animals on the shore, though birds, on the contrary,\r\n'b'abound--jacamars, couroucous, tragopans, grouse, lories, parrots,\r\n'b'cockatoos, pheasants, pigeons, and a hundred others. There was not\r\n'b'a tree without a nest, and not a nest which was not full of flapping\r\n'b'wings.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the weary explorers arrived at Reptile End. Here\r\n'b'the seaside forest ended, and the shore resumed the customary appearance\r\n'b'of a coast, with rocks, reefs, and sands. It was possible that something\r\n'b'might be found here, but darkness came on, and the further exploration\r\n'b'had to be put off to the next day.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Herbert hastened on to find a suitable place for their\r\n'b'camp. Among the last trees of the forest of the Far West, the boy found\r\n'b'several thick clumps of bamboos.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a valuable discovery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cValuable?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cI may say, Pencroft, that the bark of the\r\n'b'bamboo, cut into flexible laths, is used for making baskets; that this\r\n'b'bark, mashed into a paste, is used for the manufacture of Chinese paper;\r\n'b'that the stalks furnish, according to their size, canes and pipes\r\n'b'and are used for conducting water; that large bamboos make excellent\r\n'b'material for building, being light and strong, and being never attacked\r\n'b'by insects. I will add that by sawing the bamboo in two at the joint,\r\n'b'keeping for the bottom the part of the transverse film which forms\r\n'b'the joint, useful cups are obtained, which are much in use among the\r\n'b'Chinese. No! you don\xe2\x80\x99t care for that. But--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can tell you, if you are ignorant of it, that in India these\r\n'b'bamboos are eaten like asparagus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAsparagus thirty feet high!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd are they good?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cExcellent,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly it is not the stems of thirty feet\r\n'b'high which are eaten, but the young shoots.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerfect, my boy, perfect!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will also add that the pith of the young stalks, preserved in\r\n'b'vinegar, makes a good pickle.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBetter and better, Herbert!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd lastly, that the bamboos exude a sweet liquor which can be made\r\n'b'into a very agreeable drink.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs that all?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they don\xe2\x80\x99t happen to do for smoking?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my poor Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert and the sailor had not to look long for a place in which to pass\r\n'b'the night. The rocks, which must have been violently beaten by the\r\n'b'sea under the influence of the winds of the southwest, presented many\r\n'b'cavities in which shelter could be found against the night air. But just\r\n'b'as they were about to enter one of these caves a loud roaring arrested\r\n'b'them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBack!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cOur guns are only loaded with small shot, and\r\n'b'beasts which can roar as loud as that would care no more for it than for\r\n'b'grains of salt!\xe2\x80\x9d And the sailor, seizing Herbert by the arm, dragged\r\n'b'him behind a rock, just as a magnificent animal showed itself at the\r\n'b'entrance of the cavern.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was a jaguar of a size at least equal to its Asiatic congeners, that\r\n'b'is to say, it measured five feet from the extremity of its head to the\r\n'b'beginning of its tail. The yellow color of its hair was relieved by\r\n'b'streaks and regular oblong spots of black, which contrasted with the\r\n'b'white of its chest. Herbert recognized it as the ferocious rival of\r\n'b'the tiger, as formidable as the puma, which is the rival of the largest\r\n'b'wolf!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The jaguar advanced and gazed around him with blazing eyes, his hair\r\n'b'bristling as if this was not the first time he had scented men.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this moment the reporter appeared round a rock, and Herbert, thinking\r\n'b'that he had not seen the jaguar, was about to rush towards him, when\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett signed to him to remain where he was. This was not his\r\n'b'first tiger, and advancing to within ten feet of the animal he remained\r\n'b'motionless, his gun to his shoulder, without moving a muscle. The jaguar\r\n'b'collected itself for a spring, but at that moment a shot struck it in\r\n'b'the eyes, and it fell dead.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert and Pencroft rushed towards the jaguar. Neb and Harding also ran\r\n'b'up, and they remained for some instants contemplating the animal as it\r\n'b'lay stretched on the ground, thinking that its magnificent skin would be\r\n'b'a great ornament to the hall at Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Spilett, how I admire and envy you!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, in a fit of\r\n'b'very natural enthusiasm.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cyou could have done the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI! with such coolness!--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cImagine to yourself, Herbert, that the jaguar is only a hare, and you\r\n'b'would fire as quietly as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it is not more dangerous than a\r\n'b'hare!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9csince the jaguar has left its abode, I\r\n'b'do not see, my friends, why we should not take possession of it for the\r\n'b'night.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut others may come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be enough to light a fire at the entrance of the cavern,\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\n'b'the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand no wild beasts will dare to cross the threshold.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cInto the jaguar\xe2\x80\x99s house, then!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, dragging after him\r\n'b'the body of the animal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While Neb skinned the jaguar, his companions collected an abundant\r\n'b'supply of dry wood from the forest, which they heaped up at the cave.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, seeing the clump of bamboos, cut a quantity, which he\r\n'b'mingled with the other fuel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This done, they entered the grotto, of which the floor was strewn with\r\n'b'bones, the guns were carefully loaded, in case of a sudden attack, they\r\n'b'had supper, and then just before they lay down to rest, the heap of wood\r\n'b'piled at the entrance was set fire to. Immediately, a regular explosion,\r\n'b'or rather a series of reports, broke the silence! The noise was caused\r\n'b'by the bamboos, which, as the flames reached them, exploded like\r\n'b'fireworks. The noise was enough to terrify even the boldest of wild\r\n'b'beasts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was not the engineer who had invented this way of causing loud\r\n'b'explosions, for, according to Marco Polo, the Tartars have employed it\r\n'b'for many centuries to drive away from their encampments the formidable\r\n'b'wild beasts of Central Asia.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 5\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions slept like innocent marmots in the cave\r\n'b'which the jaguar had so politely left at their disposal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At sunrise all were on the shore at the extremity of the promontory, and\r\n'b'their gaze was directed towards the horizon, of which two-thirds of\r\n'b'the circumference were visible. For the last time the engineer could\r\n'b'ascertain that not a sail nor the wreck of a ship was on the sea, and\r\n'b'even with the telescope nothing suspicious could be discovered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was nothing either on the shore, at least, in the straight line\r\n'b'of three miles which formed the south side of the promontory, for\r\n'b'beyond that, rising ground had the rest of the coast, and even from the\r\n'b'extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula Claw Cape could not be seen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The southern coast of the island still remained to be explored. Now\r\n'b'should they undertake it immediately, and devote this day to it?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was not included in their first plan. In fact, when the boat was\r\n'b'abandoned at the sources of the Mercy, it had been agreed that after\r\n'b'having surveyed the west coast, they should go back to it, and return to\r\n'b'Granite House by the Mercy. Harding then thought that the western coast\r\n'b'would have offered refuge, either to a ship in distress, or to a vessel\r\n'b'in her regular course; but now, as he saw that this coast presented no\r\n'b'good anchorage, he wished to seek on the south what they had not been\r\n'b'able to find on the west.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett proposed to continue the exploration, that the question\r\n'b'of the supposed wreck might be completely settled, and he asked at what\r\n'b'distance Claw Cape might be from the extremity of the peninsula.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout thirty miles,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cif we take into\r\n'b'consideration the curvings of the coast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThirty miles!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cThat would be a long day\xe2\x80\x99s march.\r\n'b'Nevertheless, I think that we should return to Granite House by the\r\n'b'south coast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cfrom Claw Cape to Granite House there must be\r\n'b'at least another ten miles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMake it forty miles in all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand do not hesitate\r\n'b'to do it. At least we should survey the unknown shore, and then we shall\r\n'b'not have to begin the exploration again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery good,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cBut the boat?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe boat has remained by itself for one day at the sources of the\r\n'b'Mercy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett; \xe2\x80\x9cit may just as well stay there two\r\n'b'days! As yet, we have had no reason to think that the island is infested\r\n'b'by thieves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYet,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen I remember the history of the turtle, I am\r\n'b'far from confident of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe turtle! the turtle!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t you know that the\r\n'b'sea turned it over?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,--\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb had evidently something to say, for he opened his mouth to speak and\r\n'b'yet said nothing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want to say, Neb?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we return by the shore to Claw Cape,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cafter having\r\n'b'doubled the Cape, we shall be stopped--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy the Mercy! of course,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand we shall have neither\r\n'b'bridge nor boat by which to cross.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwith a few floating trunks we shall\r\n'b'have no difficulty in crossing the river.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be useful to construct a bridge if\r\n'b'we wish to have an easy access to the Far West!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA bridge!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cWell, is not the captain the best engineer\r\n'b'in his profession? He will make us a bridge when we want one. As to\r\n'b'transporting you this evening to the other side of the Mercy, and that\r\n'b'without wetting one thread of your clothes, I will take care of that. We\r\n'b'have provisions for another day, and besides we can get plenty of game.\r\n'b'Forward!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter\xe2\x80\x99s proposal, so strongly seconded by the sailor, received\r\n'b'general approbation, for each wished to have their doubts set at rest,\r\n'b'and by returning by Claw Cape the exploration would be ended. But there\r\n'b'was not an hour to lose, for forty miles was a long march, and they\r\n'b'could not hope to reach Granite House before night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the little band set out. As a precaution\r\n'b'the guns were loaded with ball, and Top, who led the van, received\r\n'b'orders to beat about the edge of the forest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From the extremity of the promontory which formed the tail of the\r\n'b'peninsula the coast was rounded for a distance of five miles, which\r\n'b'was rapidly passed over, without even the most minute investigations\r\n'b'bringing to light the least trace of any old or recent landings; no\r\n'b'debris, no mark of an encampment, no cinders of a fire, nor even a\r\n'b'footprint!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From the point of the peninsula on which the settlers now were their\r\n'b'gaze could extend along the southwest. Twenty-five miles off the coast\r\n'b'terminated in the Claw Cape, which loomed dimly through the morning\r\n'b'mists, and which, by the phenomenon of the mirage, appeared as if\r\n'b'suspended between land and water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Between the place occupied by the colonists and the other side of the\r\n'b'immense bay, the shore was composed, first, of a tract of low land,\r\n'b'bordered in the background by trees; then the shore became more\r\n'b'irregular, projecting sharp points into the sea, and finally ended in\r\n'b'the black rocks which, accumulated in picturesque disorder, formed Claw\r\n'b'Cape.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Such was the development of this part of the island, which the settlers\r\n'b'took in at a glance, while stopping for an instant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf a vessel ran in here,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cshe would certainly be lost.\r\n'b'Sandbanks and reefs everywhere! Bad quarters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut at least something would be left of the ship,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the\r\n'b'reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere might be pieces of wood on the rocks, but nothing on the sands,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' replied the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the sands are still more dangerous than the rocks, for they\r\n'b'swallow up everything that is thrown on them. In a few days the hull of\r\n'b'a ship of several hundred tons would disappear entirely in there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cif a ship has been wrecked on\r\n'b'these banks, is it not astonishing that there is now no trace of her\r\n'b'remaining?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, captain, with the aid of time and tempest. However, it would be\r\n'b'surprising, even in this case, that some of the masts or spars should\r\n'b'not have been thrown on the beach, out of reach of the waves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on with our search, then,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At one o\xe2\x80\x99clock the colonists arrived at the other side of Washington\r\n'b'Bay, they having now gone a distance of twenty miles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They then halted for breakfast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Here began the irregular coast, covered with lines of rocks and\r\n'b'sandbanks. The long sea-swell could be seen breaking over the rocks in\r\n'b'the bay, forming a foamy fringe. From this point to Claw Cape the beach\r\n'b'was very narrow between the edge of the forest and the reefs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Walking was now more difficult, on account of the numerous rocks which\r\n'b'encumbered the beach. The granite cliff also gradually increased in\r\n'b'height, and only the green tops of the trees which crowned it could be\r\n'b'seen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After half an hour\xe2\x80\x99s rest, the settlers resumed their journey, and not\r\n'b'a spot among the rocks was left unexamined. Pencroft and Neb even rushed\r\n'b'into the surf whenever any object attracted their attention. But they\r\n'b'found nothing, some curious formations of the rocks having deceived\r\n'b'them. They ascertained, however, that eatable shellfish abounded there,\r\n'b'but these could not be of any great advantage to them until some easy\r\n'b'means of communication had been established between the two banks of the\r\n'b'Mercy, and until the means of transport had been perfected.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nothing therefore which threw any light on the supposed wreck could be\r\n'b'found on this shore, yet an object of any importance, such as the hull\r\n'b'of a ship, would have been seen directly, or any of her masts and spars\r\n'b'would have been washed on shore, just as the chest had been, which was\r\n'b'found twenty miles from here. But there was nothing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards three o\xe2\x80\x99clock Harding and his companions arrived at a snug\r\n'b'little creek. It formed quite a natural harbor, invisible from the sea,\r\n'b'and was entered by a narrow channel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At the back of this creek some violent convulsion had torn up the\r\n'b'rocky border, and a cutting, by a gentle slope, gave access to an upper\r\n'b'plateau, which might be situated at least ten miles from Claw Cape, and\r\n'b'consequently four miles in a straight line from Prospect Heights. Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett proposed to his companions that they should make a halt here.\r\n'b'They agreed readily, for their walk had sharpened their appetites;\r\n'b'and although it was not their usual dinner-hour, no one refused to\r\n'b'strengthen himself with a piece of venison. This luncheon would sustain\r\n'b'them until their supper, which they intended to take at Granite House.\r\n'b'In a few minutes the settlers, seated under a clump of fine sea-pines,\r\n'b'were devouring the provisions which Neb produced from his bag.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This spot was raised from fifty to sixty feet above the level of the\r\n'b'sea. The view was very extensive, but beyond the cape it ended in Union\r\n'b'Bay. Neither the islet nor Prospect Heights was visible, and could not\r\n'b'be from thence, for the rising ground and the curtain of trees closed\r\n'b'the northern horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is useless to add that notwithstanding the wide extent of sea which\r\n'b'the explorers could survey, and though the engineer swept the horizon\r\n'b'with his glass, no vessel could be found.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The shore was of course examined with the same care from the edge of the\r\n'b'water to the cliff, and nothing could be discovered even with the aid of\r\n'b'the instrument.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems we must make up our minds to\r\n'b'console ourselves with thinking that no one will come to dispute with us\r\n'b'the possession of Lincoln Island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut the bullet,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cThat was not imaginary, I suppose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHang it, no!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, thinking of his absent tooth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen what conclusion may be drawn?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat three months or more ago, a vessel,\r\n'b'either voluntarily or not, came here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! then you admit, Cyrus, that she was swallowed up without leaving\r\n'b'any trace?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my dear Spilett; but you see that if it is certain that a human\r\n'b'being set foot on the island, it appears no less certain that he has now\r\n'b'left it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, if I understand you right, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthe vessel\r\n'b'has left again?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we have lost an opportunity to get back to our country?\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI fear so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, since the opportunity is lost, let us go on; it can\xe2\x80\x99t be\r\n'b'helped,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, who felt home-sickness for Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But just as they were rising, Top was heard loudly barking; and the dog\r\n'b'issued from the wood, holding in his mouth a rag soiled with mud.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb seized it. It was a piece of strong cloth!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top still barked, and by his going and coming, seemed to invite his\r\n'b'master to follow him into the forest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow there\xe2\x80\x99s something to explain the bullet!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA castaway!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWounded, perhaps!\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOr dead!\xe2\x80\x9d added the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All ran after the dog, among the tall pines on the border of the forest.\r\n'b'Harding and his companions made ready their firearms, in case of an\r\n'b'emergency.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They advanced some way into the wood, but to their great disappointment,\r\n'b'they as yet saw no signs of any human being having passed that way.\r\n'b'Shrubs and creepers were uninjured, and they had even to cut them away\r\n'b'with the axe, as they had done in the deepest recesses of the forest.\r\n'b'It was difficult to fancy that any human creature had ever passed there,\r\n'b'but yet Top went backward and forward, not like a dog who searches at\r\n'b'random, but like a dog being endowed with a mind, who is following up an\r\n'b'idea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In about seven or eight minutes Top stopped in a glade surrounded with\r\n'b'tall trees. The settlers gazed around them, but saw nothing, neither\r\n'b'under the bushes nor among the trees.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Top?\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top barked louder, bounding about at the foot of a gigantic pine. All at\r\n'b'once Pencroft shouted,--\xe2\x80\x9cHo, splendid! capital!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have been looking for a wreck at sea or on land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell; and here we\xe2\x80\x99ve found one in the air!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor pointed to a great white rag, caught in the top of the\r\n'b'pine, a fallen scrap of which the dog had brought to them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut that is not a wreck!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI beg your pardon!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy? is it--?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is all that remains of our airy boat, of our balloon, which has been\r\n'b'caught up aloft there, at the top of that tree!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft was not mistaken, and he gave vent to his feelings in a\r\n'b'tremendous hurrah, adding,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is good cloth! There is what will furnish us with linen for\r\n'b'years. There is what will make us handkerchiefs and shirts! Ha, ha, Mr.\r\n'b'Spilett, what do you say to an island where shirts grow on the trees?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was certainly a lucky circumstance for the settlers in Lincoln Island\r\n'b'that the balloon, after having made its last bound into the air, had\r\n'b'fallen on the island and thus given them the opportunity of finding it\r\n'b'again, whether they kept the case under its present form, or whether\r\n'b'they wished to attempt another escape by it, or whether they usefully\r\n'b'employed the several hundred yards of cotton, which was of fine quality.\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s joy was therefore shared by all.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But it was necessary to bring down the remains of the balloon from\r\n'b'the tree, to place it in security, and this was no slight task. Neb,\r\n'b'Herbert, and the sailor, climbing to the summit of the tree, used all\r\n'b'their skill to disengage the now reduced balloon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The operation lasted two hours, and then not only the case, with its\r\n'b'valve, its springs, its brasswork, lay on the ground, but the net, that\r\n'b'is to say a considerable quantity of ropes and cordage, and the\r\n'b'circle and the anchor. The case, except for the fracture, was in good\r\n'b'condition, only the lower portion being torn.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was a fortune which had fallen from the sky.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll the same, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cif we ever decide to leave\r\n'b'the island, it won\xe2\x80\x99t be in a balloon, will it? These airboats won\xe2\x80\x99t go\r\n'b'where we want them to go, and we have had some experience in that way!\r\n'b'Look here, we will build a craft of some twenty tons, and then we can\r\n'b'make a main-sail, a foresail, and a jib out of that cloth. As to the\r\n'b'rest of it, that will help to dress us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the meantime, we must put it in a safe place,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They certainly could not think of carrying this load of cloth,\r\n'b'ropes, and cordage, to Granite House, for the weight of it was very\r\n'b'considerable, and while waiting for a suitable vehicle in which to\r\n'b'convey it, it was of importance that this treasure should not be left\r\n'b'longer exposed to the mercies of the first storm. The settlers, uniting\r\n'b'their efforts, managed to drag it as far as the shore, where they\r\n'b'discovered a large rocky cavity, which owing to its position could not\r\n'b'be visited either by the wind or rain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe needed a locker, and now we have one,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as we\r\n'b'cannot lock it up, it will be prudent to hide the opening. I don\xe2\x80\x99t mean\r\n'b'from two-legged thieves, but from those with four paws!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock, all was stowed away, and after having given the creek\r\n'b'the very suitable name of \xe2\x80\x9cPort Balloon,\xe2\x80\x9d the settlers pursued their\r\n'b'way along Claw Cape. Pencroft and the engineer talked of the different\r\n'b'projects which it was agreed to put into execution with the briefest\r\n'b'possible delay. It was necessary first of all to throw a bridge over the\r\n'b'Mercy, so as to establish an easy communication with the south of the\r\n'b'island; then the cart must be taken to bring back the balloon, for the\r\n'b'canoe alone could not carry it, then they would build a decked boat, and\r\n'b'Pencroft would rig it as a cutter, and they would be able to undertake\r\n'b'voyages of circumnavigation round the island, etc.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile night came on, and it was already dark when the\r\n'b'settlers reached Flotsam Point, where they had found the precious chest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The distance between Flotsam Point and Granite House was another four\r\n'b'miles, and it was midnight when, after having followed the shore to the\r\n'b'mouth of the Mercy, the settlers arrived at the first angle formed by\r\n'b'the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There the river was eighty feet in breadth, which was awkward to cross,\r\n'b'but as Pencroft had taken upon himself to conquer this difficulty, he\r\n'b'was compelled to do it. The settlers certainly had reason to be pretty\r\n'b'tired. The journey had been long, and the task of getting down the\r\n'b'balloon had not rested either their arms or legs. They were anxious\r\n'b'to reach Granite House to eat and sleep, and if the bridge had been\r\n'b'constructed, in a quarter of an hour they would have been at home.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night was very dark. Pencroft prepared to keep his promise by\r\n'b'constructing a sort of raft, on which to make the passage of the Mercy.\r\n'b'He and Neb, armed with axes, chose two trees near the water, and began\r\n'b'to attack them at the base.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Spilett, seated on the bank, waited till their\r\n'b'companions were ready for their help, while Herbert roamed about, though\r\n'b'without going to any distance. All at once, the lad, who had strolled by\r\n'b'the river, came running back, and, pointing up the Mercy, exclaimed,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is floating there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft stopped working, and seeing an indistinct object moving through\r\n'b'the gloom,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA canoe!\xe2\x80\x9d cried he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All approached, and saw to their extreme surprise, a boat floating down\r\n'b'the current.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBoat ahoy!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the sailor, without thinking that perhaps it would\r\n'b'be best to keep silence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No reply. The boat still drifted onward, and it was not more than twelve\r\n'b'feet off, when the sailor exclaimed,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is our own boat! she has broken her moorings, and floated down\r\n'b'the current. I must say she has arrived very opportunely.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur boat?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft was right. It was indeed the canoe, of which the rope had\r\n'b'undoubtedly broken, and which had come alone from the sources of the\r\n'b'Mercy. It was very important to seize it before the rapid current should\r\n'b'have swept it away out of the mouth of the river, but Neb and Pencroft\r\n'b'cleverly managed this by means of a long pole.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The canoe touched the shore. The engineer leaped in first, and found,\r\n'b'on examining the rope, that it had been really worn through by rubbing\r\n'b'against the rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter to him, in a low voice, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a strange\r\n'b'thing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStrange indeed!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Strange or not, it was very fortunate. Herbert, the reporter, Neb, and\r\n'b'Pencroft, embarked in turn. There was no doubt about the rope having\r\n'b'been worn through, but the astonishing part of the affair was, that the\r\n'b'boat should arrive just at the moment when the settlers were there to\r\n'b'seize it on its way, for a quarter of an hour earlier or later it would\r\n'b'have been lost in the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'If they had been living in the time of genii, this incident would\r\n'b'have given them the right to think that the island was haunted by some\r\n'b'supernatural being, who used his power in the service of the castaways!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few strokes of the oar brought the settlers to the mouth of the\r\n'b'Mercy. The canoe was hauled up on the beach near the Chimneys, and all\r\n'b'proceeded towards the ladder of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But at that moment, Top barked angrily, and Neb, who was looking for the\r\n'b'first steps, uttered a cry.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no longer a ladder!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 6\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding stood still, without saying a word. His companions\r\n'b'searched in the darkness on the wall, in case the wind should have\r\n'b'moved the ladder, and on the ground, thinking that it might have fallen\r\n'b'down.... But the ladder had quite disappeared. As to ascertaining if\r\n'b'a squall had blown it on the landing-place, half way up, that was\r\n'b'impossible in the dark.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is a joke,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a very stupid one! To come\r\n'b'home and find no staircase to go up to your room by--that\xe2\x80\x99s nothing for\r\n'b'weary men to laugh at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb could do nothing but cry out \xe2\x80\x9cOh! oh! oh!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI begin to think that very curious things happen in Lincoln Island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCurious?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cnot at all, Pencroft, nothing can be\r\n'b'more natural. Some one has come during our absence, taken possession of\r\n'b'our dwelling and drawn up the ladder.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome one,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cBut who?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho but the hunter who fired the bullet?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if there is any one up there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, who began to\r\n'b'lose patience, \xe2\x80\x9cI will give them a hail, and they must answer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And in a stentorian voice the sailor gave a prolonged \xe2\x80\x9cHalloo!\xe2\x80\x9d which\r\n'b'was echoed again and again from the cliff and rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers listened and they thought they heard a sort of chuckling\r\n'b'laugh, of which they could not guess the origin. But no voice replied to\r\n'b'Pencroft, who in vain repeated his vigorous shouts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was something indeed in this to astonish the most apathetic\r\n'b'of men, and the settlers were not men of that description. In their\r\n'b'situation every incident had its importance, and, certainly, during the\r\n'b'seven months which they had spent on the island, they had not before met\r\n'b'with anything of so surprising a character.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Be that as it may, forgetting their fatigue in the singularity of the\r\n'b'event, they remained below Granite House, not knowing what to think,\r\n'b'not knowing what to do, questioning each other without any hope of\r\n'b'a satisfactory reply, every one starting some supposition each more\r\n'b'unlikely than the last. Neb bewailed himself, much disappointed at not\r\n'b'being able to get into his kitchen, for the provisions which they\r\n'b'had had on their expedition were exhausted, and they had no means of\r\n'b'renewing them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d at last said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is only one thing to be\r\n'b'done at present; wait for day, and then act according to circumstances.\r\n'b'But let us go to the Chimneys. There we shall be under shelter, and if\r\n'b'we cannot eat, we can at least sleep.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut who is it that has played us this cool trick?\xe2\x80\x9d again asked\r\n'b'Pencroft, unable to make up his mind to retire from the spot.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Whoever it was, the only thing practicable was to do as the engineer\r\n'b'proposed, to go to the Chimneys and there wait for day. In the meanwhile\r\n'b'Top was ordered to mount guard below the windows of Granite House, and\r\n'b'when Top received an order he obeyed it without any questioning. The\r\n'b'brave dog therefore remained at the foot of the cliff while his master\r\n'b'with his companions sought a refuge among the rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To say that the settlers, notwithstanding their fatigue, slept well on\r\n'b'the sandy floor of the Chimneys would not be true. It was not only that\r\n'b'they were extremely anxious to find out the cause of what had happened,\r\n'b'whether it was the result of an accident which would be discovered at\r\n'b'the return of day, or whether on the contrary it was the work of a human\r\n'b'being; but they also had very uncomfortable beds. That could not be\r\n'b'helped, however, for in some way or other at that moment their dwelling\r\n'b'was occupied, and they could not possibly enter it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now Granite House was more than their dwelling, it was their warehouse.\r\n'b'There were all the stores belonging to the colony, weapons, instruments,\r\n'b'tools, ammunition, provisions, etc. To think that all that might be\r\n'b'pillaged and that the settlers would have all their work to do over\r\n'b'again, fresh weapons and tools to make, was a serious matter. Their\r\n'b'uneasiness led one or other of them also to go out every few minutes to\r\n'b'see if Top was keeping good watch. Cyrus Harding alone waited with his\r\n'b'habitual patience, although his strong mind was exasperated at being\r\n'b'confronted with such an inexplicable fact, and he was provoked at\r\n'b'himself for allowing a feeling to which he could not give a name, to\r\n'b'gain an influence over him. Gideon Spilett shared his feelings in this\r\n'b'respect, and the two conversed together in whispers of the inexplicable\r\n'b'circumstance which baffled even their intelligence and experience.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a joke,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cit is a trick some one has played us.\r\n'b'Well, I don\xe2\x80\x99t like such jokes, and the joker had better look out for\r\n'b'himself, if he falls into my hands, I can tell him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As soon as the first gleam of light appeared in the east, the colonists,\r\n'b'suitably armed, repaired to the beach under Granite House. The rising\r\n'b'sun now shone on the cliff and they could see the windows, the shutters\r\n'b'of which were closed, through the curtains of foliage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All here was in order; but a cry escaped the colonists when they saw\r\n'b'that the door, which they had closed on their departure, was now wide\r\n'b'open.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Some one had entered Granite House--there could be no more doubt about\r\n'b'that.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The upper ladder, which generally hung from the door to the landing,\r\n'b'was in its place, but the lower ladder was drawn up and raised to\r\n'b'the threshold. It was evident that the intruders had wished to guard\r\n'b'themselves against a surprise.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft hailed again.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No reply.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe beggars,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cThere they are sleeping quietly\r\n'b'as if they were in their own house. Hallo there, you pirates, brigands,\r\n'b'robbers, sons of John Bull!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When Pencroft, being a Yankee, treated any one to the epithet of \xe2\x80\x9cson of\r\n'b'John Bull,\xe2\x80\x9d he considered he had reached the last limits of insult.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sun had now completely risen, and the whole facade of Granite House\r\n'b'became illuminated by its rays; but in the interior as well as on the\r\n'b'exterior all was quiet and calm.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers asked if Granite House was inhabited or not, and yet the\r\n'b'position of the ladder was sufficient to show that it was; it was also\r\n'b'certain that the inhabitants, whoever they might be, had not been able\r\n'b'to escape. But how were they to be got at?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert then thought of fastening a cord to an arrow, and shooting the\r\n'b'arrow so that it should pass between the first rounds of the ladder\r\n'b'which hung from the threshold. By means of the cord they would then\r\n'b'be able to draw down the ladder to the ground, and so re-establish the\r\n'b'communication between the beach and Granite House. There was evidently\r\n'b'nothing else to be done, and, with a little skill, this method might\r\n'b'succeed. Very fortunately bows and arrows had been left at the Chimneys,\r\n'b'where they also found a quantity of light hibiscus cord. Pencroft\r\n'b'fastened this to a well-feathered arrow. Then Herbert fixing it to his\r\n'b'bow, took a careful aim for the lower part of the ladder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Pencroft, and Neb drew back, so as to see\r\n'b'if anything appeared at the windows. The reporter lifted his gun to his\r\n'b'shoulder and covered the door.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The bow was bent, the arrow flew, taking the cord with it, and passed\r\n'b'between the two last rounds.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The operation had succeeded.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert immediately seized the end of the cord, but, at that moment when\r\n'b'he gave it a pull to bring down the ladder, an arm, thrust suddenly out\r\n'b'between the wall and the door, grasped it and dragged it inside Granite\r\n'b'House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe rascals!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cIf a ball can do anything for you,\r\n'b'you shall not have long to wait for it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut who was it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho was it? Didn\xe2\x80\x99t you see?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was a monkey, a sapajou, an orangoutang, a baboon, a gorilla, a\r\n'b'sagoin. Our dwelling has been invaded by monkeys, who climbed up the\r\n'b'ladder during our absence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, at this moment, as if to bear witness to the truth of the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'words, two or three quadrumana showed themselves at the windows,\r\n'b'from which they had pushed back the shutters, and saluted the real\r\n'b'proprietors of the place with a thousand hideous grimaces.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew that it was only a joke,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cbut one of the jokers\r\n'b'shall pay the penalty for the rest.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So saying, the sailor, raising his piece, took a rapid aim at one of the\r\n'b'monkeys and fired. All disappeared, except one who fell mortally wounded\r\n'b'on the beach. This monkey, which was of a large size, evidently belonged\r\n'b'to the first order of the quadrumana. Whether this was a chimpanzee, an\r\n'b'orangoutang, or a gorilla, he took rank among the anthropoid apes, who\r\n'b'are so called from their resemblance to the human race. However, Herbert\r\n'b'declared it to be an orangoutang.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a magnificent beast!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMagnificent, if you like,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cbut still I do not see\r\n'b'how we are to get into our house.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert is a good marksman,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand his bow is here.\r\n'b'He can try again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, these apes are so cunning,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cthey won\xe2\x80\x99t show\r\n'b'themselves again at the windows and so we can\xe2\x80\x99t kill them; and when I\r\n'b'think of the mischief they may do in the rooms and storehouse--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave patience,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cthese creatures cannot keep us long\r\n'b'at bay.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be sure of that till I see them down here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\n'b'sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd now, captain, do you know how many dozens of these fellows\r\n'b'are up there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was difficult to reply to Pencroft, and as for the young boy making\r\n'b'another attempt, that was not easy; for the lower part of the ladder\r\n'b'had been drawn again into the door, and when another pull was given, the\r\n'b'line broke and the ladder remained firm. The case was really perplexing.\r\n'b'Pencroft stormed. There was a comic side to the situation, but he did\r\n'b'not think it funny at all. It was certain that the settlers would end by\r\n'b'reinstating themselves in their domicile and driving out the intruders,\r\n'b'but when and how? this is what they were not able to say.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two hours passed, during which the apes took care not to show\r\n'b'themselves, but they were still there, and three or four times a nose or\r\n'b'a paw was poked out at the door or windows, and was immediately saluted\r\n'b'by a gun-shot.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us hide ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d at last said the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps the apes\r\n'b'will think we have gone quite away and will show themselves again. Let\r\n'b'Spilett and Herbert conceal themselves behind those rocks and fire on\r\n'b'all that may appear.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s orders were obeyed, and while the reporter and the lad,\r\n'b'the best marksmen in the colony, posted themselves in a good position,\r\n'b'but out of the monkeys\xe2\x80\x99 sight, Neb, Pencroft, and Cyrus climbed the\r\n'b'plateau and entered the forest in order to kill some game, for it was\r\n'b'now time for breakfast and they had no provisions remaining.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In half an hour the hunters returned with a few rock pigeons, which they\r\n'b'roasted as well as they could. Not an ape had appeared. Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'and Herbert went to take their share of the breakfast, leaving Top to\r\n'b'watch under the windows. They then, having eaten, returned to their\r\n'b'post.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two hours later, their situation was in no degree improved. The\r\n'b'quadrumana gave no sign of existence, and it might have been supposed\r\n'b'that they had disappeared; but what seemed more probable was that,\r\n'b'terrified by the death of one of their companions, and frightened by the\r\n'b'noise of the firearms, they had retreated to the back part of the house\r\n'b'or probably even into the store-room. And when they thought of\r\n'b'the valuables which this storeroom contained, the patience so much\r\n'b'recommended by the engineer, fast changed into great irritation, and\r\n'b'there certainly was room for it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly it is too bad,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter; \xe2\x80\x9cand the worst of it is,\r\n'b'there is no way of putting an end to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must drive these vagabonds out somehow,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe could soon get the better of them, even if there are twenty of the\r\n'b'rascals; but for that, we must meet them hand to hand. Come now, is\r\n'b'there no way of getting at them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try to enter Granite House by the old opening at the lake,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand I never thought of that.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was in reality the only way by which to penetrate into Granite\r\n'b'House so as to fight with and drive out the intruders. The opening was,\r\n'b'it is true, closed up with a wall of cemented stones, which it would be\r\n'b'necessary to sacrifice, but that could easily be rebuilt. Fortunately,\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had not as yet effected his project of hiding this opening\r\n'b'by raising the waters of the lake, for the operation would then have\r\n'b'taken some time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was already past twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock, when the colonists, well armed and\r\n'b'provided with picks and spades, left the Chimneys, passed beneath the\r\n'b'windows of Granite House, after telling Top to remain at his post, and\r\n'b'began to ascend the left bank of the Mercy, so as to reach Prospect\r\n'b'Heights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But they had not made fifty steps in this direction, when they heard the\r\n'b'dog barking furiously.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And all rushed down the bank again.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Arrived at the turning, they saw that the situation had changed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, the apes, seized with a sudden panic, from some unknown cause,\r\n'b'were trying to escape. Two or three ran and clambered from one window\r\n'b'to another with the agility of acrobats. They were not even trying to\r\n'b'replace the ladder, by which it would have been easy to descend; perhaps\r\n'b'in their terror they had forgotten this way of escape. The colonists,\r\n'b'now being able to take aim without difficulty, fired. Some, wounded or\r\n'b'killed, fell back into the rooms, uttering piercing cries. The rest,\r\n'b'throwing themselves out, were dashed to pieces in their fall, and in a\r\n'b'few minutes, so far as they knew, there was not a living quadrumana in\r\n'b'Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this moment the ladder was seen to slip over the threshold, then\r\n'b'unroll and fall to the ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHullo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is queer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery strange!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the engineer, leaping first up the ladder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTake care, captain!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps there are still some of\r\n'b'these rascals.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall soon see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, without stopping however.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All his companions followed him, and in a minute they had arrived at the\r\n'b'threshold. They searched everywhere. There was no one in the rooms nor\r\n'b'in the storehouse, which had been respected by the band of quadrumana.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell now, and the ladder,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cwho can the gentleman\r\n'b'have been who sent us that down?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But at that moment a cry was heard, and a great orang, who had hidden\r\n'b'himself in the passage, rushed into the room, pursued by Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh, the robber!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And hatchet in hand, he was about to cleave the head of the animal, when\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding seized his arm, saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpare him, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPardon this rascal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! it was he who threw us the ladder!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the engineer said this in such a peculiar voice that it was\r\n'b'difficult to know whether he spoke seriously or not.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nevertheless, they threw themselves on the orang, who defended himself\r\n'b'gallantly, but was soon overpowered and bound.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd what shall we make of him, now we\xe2\x80\x99ve got\r\n'b'him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA servant!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The lad was not joking in saying this, for he knew how this intelligent\r\n'b'race could be turned to account.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers then approached the ape and gazed at it attentively. He\r\n'b'belonged to the family of anthropoid apes, of which the facial angle is\r\n'b'not much inferior to that of the Australians and Hottentots. It was an\r\n'b'orangoutang, and as such, had neither the ferocity of the gorilla, nor\r\n'b'the stupidity of the baboon. It is to this family of the anthropoid apes\r\n'b'that so many characteristics belong which prove them to be possessed\r\n'b'of an almost human intelligence. Employed in houses, they can wait at\r\n'b'table, sweep rooms, brush clothes, clean boots, handle a knife, fork,\r\n'b'and spoon properly, and even drink wine... doing everything as well as\r\n'b'the best servant that ever walked upon two legs. Buffon possessed one\r\n'b'of these apes, who served him for a long time as a faithful and zealous\r\n'b'servant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The one which had been seized in the hall of Granite House was a great\r\n'b'fellow, six feet high, with an admirably poportioned frame, a broad\r\n'b'chest, head of a moderate size, the facial angle reaching sixty-five\r\n'b'degrees, round skull, projecting nose, skin covered with soft glossy\r\n'b'hair, in short, a fine specimen of the anthropoids. His eyes, rather\r\n'b'smaller than human eyes, sparkled with intelligence; his white teeth\r\n'b'glittered under his mustache, and he wore a little curly brown beard.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA handsome fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cif we only knew his language, we\r\n'b'could talk to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, master,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, \xe2\x80\x9care you serious? Are we going to take him as a\r\n'b'servant?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, smiling. \xe2\x80\x9cBut you must not be\r\n'b'jealous.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I hope he will make an excellent servant,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\n'b'appears young, and will be easy to educate, and we shall not be obliged\r\n'b'to use force to subdue him, nor draw his teeth, as is sometimes done. He\r\n'b'will soon grow fond of his masters if they are kind to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they will be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, who had forgotten all his rancor\r\n'b'against \xe2\x80\x9cthe jokers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, approaching the orang,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, old boy!\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9chow are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The orang replied by a little grunt which did not show any anger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou wish to join the colony?\xe2\x80\x9d again asked the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are going to\r\n'b'enter the service of Captain Cyrus Harding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Another respondent grunt was uttered by the ape.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you will be satisfied with no other wages than your food?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Third affirmative grunt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis conversation is slightly monotonous,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo much the better,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cthe best servants are those who\r\n'b'talk the least. And then, no wages, do you hear, my boy? We will give\r\n'b'you no wages at first, but we will double them afterwards if we are\r\n'b'pleased with you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus the colony was increased by a new member. As to his name the sailor\r\n'b'begged that in memory of another ape which he had known, he might be\r\n'b'called Jupiter, and Jup for short.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And so, without more ceremony, Master Jup was installed in Granite\r\n'b'House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 7\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers in Lincoln Island had now regained their dwelling, without\r\n'b'having been obliged to reach it by the old opening, and were therefore\r\n'b'spared the trouble of mason\xe2\x80\x99s work. It was certainly lucky, that at the\r\n'b'moment they were about to set out to do so, the apes had been seized\r\n'b'with that terror, no less sudden than inexplicable, which had driven\r\n'b'them out of Granite House. Had the animals discovered that they\r\n'b'were about to be attacked from another direction? This was the only\r\n'b'explanation of their sudden retreat.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the day the bodies of the apes were carried into the wood, where\r\n'b'they were buried; then the settlers busied themselves in repairing the\r\n'b'disorder caused by the intruders, disorder but not damage, for although\r\n'b'they had turned everything in the rooms topsy-turvy, yet they had broken\r\n'b'nothing. Neb relighted his stove, and the stores in the larder furnished\r\n'b'a substantial repast, to which all did ample justice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Jup was not forgotten, and he ate with relish some stonepine almonds\r\n'b'and rhizome roots, with which he was abundantly supplied. Pencroft had\r\n'b'unfastened his arms, but judged it best to have his legs tied until they\r\n'b'were more sure of his submission.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, before retiring to rest, Harding and his companions seated round\r\n'b'their table, discussed those plans, the execution of which was most\r\n'b'pressing. The most important and most urgent was the establishment of a\r\n'b'bridge over the Mercy, so as to form a communication with the southern\r\n'b'part of the island and Granite House; then the making of an enclosure\r\n'b'for the musmons or other woolly animals which they wished to capture.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These two projects would help to solve the difficulty as to their\r\n'b'clothing, which was now serious. The bridge would render easy the\r\n'b'transport of the balloon case, which would furnish them with linen, and\r\n'b'the inhabitants of the enclosure would yield wool which would supply\r\n'b'them with winter clothes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the enclosure, it was Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s intention to establish it at\r\n'b'the sources of the Red Creek, where the ruminants would find fresh and\r\n'b'abundant pasture. The road between Prospect Heights and the sources of\r\n'b'the stream was already partly beaten, and with a better cart than the\r\n'b'first, the material could be easily conveyed to the spot, especially if\r\n'b'they could manage to capture some animals to draw it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But though there might be no inconvenience in the enclosure being so far\r\n'b'from Granite House, it would not be the same with the poultry-yard, to\r\n'b'which Neb called the attention of the colonists. It was indeed necessary\r\n'b'that the birds should be close within reach of the cook, and no place\r\n'b'appeared more favorable for the establishment of the said poultry-yard\r\n'b'than that portion of the banks of the lake which was close to the old\r\n'b'opening.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Water-birds would prosper there as well as others, and the couple\r\n'b'of tinamous taken in their last excursion would be the first to be\r\n'b'domesticated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 3rd of November, the new works were begun by the\r\n'b'construction of the bridge, and all hands were required for this\r\n'b'important task. Saws, hatchets, and hammers were shouldered by the\r\n'b'settlers, who, now transformed into carpenters, descended to the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There Pencroft observed,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSuppose, that during our absence, Master Jup takes it into his head to\r\n'b'draw up the ladder which he so politely returned to us yesterday?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us tie its lower end down firmly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was done by means of two stakes securely fixed in the sand. Then\r\n'b'the settlers, ascending the left bank of the Mercy, soon arrived at the\r\n'b'angle formed by the river.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There they halted, in order to ascertain if the bridge could be thrown\r\n'b'across. The place appeared suitable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, from this spot, to Port Balloon, discovered the day before on\r\n'b'the southern coast, there was only a distance of three miles and a\r\n'b'half, and from the bridge to the Port, it would be easy to make a good\r\n'b'cart-road which would render the communication between Granite House and\r\n'b'the south of the island extremely easy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding now imparted to his companions a scheme for completely\r\n'b'isolating Prospect Heights so as to shelter it from the attacks both of\r\n'b'quadrupeds and quadrumana. In this way, Granite House, the Chimneys, the\r\n'b'poultry-yard, and all the upper part of the plateau which was to be used\r\n'b'for cultivation, would be protected against the depredations of animals.\r\n'b'Nothing could be easier than to execute this project, and this is how\r\n'b'the engineer intended to set to work.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The plateau was already defended on three sides by water-courses, either\r\n'b'artificial or natural. On the northwest, by the shores of Lake Grant,\r\n'b'from the entrance of the passage to the breach made in the banks of the\r\n'b'lake for the escape of the water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the north, from this breach to the sea, by the new water-course which\r\n'b'had hollowed out a bed for itself across the plateau and shore, above\r\n'b'and below the fall, and it would be enough to dig the bed of this creek\r\n'b'a little deeper to make it impracticable for animals, on all the eastern\r\n'b'border by the sea itself, from the mouth of the aforesaid creek to the\r\n'b'mouth of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Lastly, on the south, from the mouth to the turn of the Mercy where the\r\n'b'bridge was to be established.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The western border of the plateau now remained between the turn of the\r\n'b'river and the southern angle of the lake, a distance of about a mile,\r\n'b'which was open to all comers. But nothing could be easier than to dig a\r\n'b'broad deep ditch, which could be filled from the lake, and the overflow\r\n'b'of which would throw itself by a rapid fall into the bed of the Mercy.\r\n'b'The level of the lake would, no doubt, be somewhat lowered by this fresh\r\n'b'discharge of its waters, but Cyrus Harding had ascertained that the\r\n'b'volume of water in the Red Creek was considerable enough to allow of the\r\n'b'execution of this project.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo then,\xe2\x80\x9d added the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cProspect Heights will become a regular\r\n'b'island, being surrounded with water on all sides, and only communicating\r\n'b'with the rest of our domain by the bridge which we are about to throw\r\n'b'across the Mercy, the two little bridges already established above and\r\n'b'below the fall; and, lastly, two other little bridges which must be\r\n'b'constructed, one over the canal which I propose to dig, the other across\r\n'b'to the left bank of the Mercy. Now, if these bridges can be raised at\r\n'b'will, Prospect Heights will be guarded from any surprise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The bridge was the most urgent work. Trees were selected, cut down,\r\n'b'stripped of their branches, and cut into beams, joists, and planks. The\r\n'b'end of the bridge which rested on the right bank of the Mercy was to be\r\n'b'firm, but the other end on the left bank was to be movable, so that it\r\n'b'might be raised by means of a counterpoise, as some canal bridges are\r\n'b'managed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was certainly a considerable work, and though it was skillfully\r\n'b'conducted, it took some time, for the Mercy at this place was eighty\r\n'b'feet wide. It was therefore necessary to fix piles in the bed of\r\n'b'the river so as to sustain the floor of the bridge and establish a\r\n'b'pile-driver to act on the tops of these piles, which would thus form two\r\n'b'arches and allow the bridge to support heavy loads.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Happily there was no want of tools with which to shape the wood, nor\r\n'b'of iron-work to make it firm, nor of the ingenuity of a man who had a\r\n'b'marvelous knowledge of the work, nor lastly, the zeal of his companions,\r\n'b'who in seven months had necessarily acquired great skill in the use of\r\n'b'their tools; and it must be said that not the least skilful was Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, who in dexterity almost equaled the sailor himself. \xe2\x80\x9cWho would\r\n'b'ever have expected so much from a newspaper man!\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The construction of the Mercy bridge lasted three weeks of regular\r\n'b'hard work. They even breakfasted on the scene of their labors, and the\r\n'b'weather being magnificent, they only returned to Granite House to sleep.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this period it may be stated that Master Jup grew more accustomed\r\n'b'to his new masters, whose movements he always watched with very\r\n'b'inquisitive eyes. However, as a precautionary measure, Pencroft did not\r\n'b'as yet allow him complete liberty, rightly wishing to wait until the\r\n'b'limits of the plateau should be settled by the projected works. Top\r\n'b'and Jup were good friends and played willingly together, but Jup did\r\n'b'everything solemnly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 20th of November the bridge was finished. The movable part,\r\n'b'balanced by the counterpoise, swung easily, and only a slight effort was\r\n'b'needed to raise it; between its hinge and the last cross-bar on which\r\n'b'it rested when closed, there existed a space of twenty feet, which was\r\n'b'sufficiently wide to prevent any animals from crossing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers now began to talk of fetching the balloon-case, which they\r\n'b'were anxious to place in perfect security; but to bring it, it would be\r\n'b'necessary to take a cart to Port Balloon, and consequently, necessary to\r\n'b'beat a road through the dense forests of the Far West. This would take\r\n'b'some time. Also, Neb and Pencroft having gone to examine into the state\r\n'b'of things at Port Balloon, and reported that the stock of cloth would\r\n'b'suffer no damage in the grotto where it was stored, it was decided that\r\n'b'the work at Prospect Heights should not be discontinued.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwill enable us to establish our poultry-yard\r\n'b'under better conditions, since we need have no fear of visits from foxes\r\n'b'nor the attacks of other beasts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d added Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can clear the plateau, and transplant wild plants\r\n'b'to it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd prepare our second corn-field!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor with a triumphant\r\n'b'air.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, the first corn-field sown with a single grain had prospered\r\n'b'admirably, thanks to Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s care. It had produced the ten ears\r\n'b'foretold by the engineer, and each ear containing eighty grains, the\r\n'b'colony found itself in possession of eight hundred grains, in six\r\n'b'months, which promised a double harvest each year.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These eight hundred grains, except fifty, which were prudently reserved,\r\n'b'were to be sown in a new field, but with no less care than was bestowed\r\n'b'on the single grain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The field was prepared, then surrounded with a strong palisade, high and\r\n'b'pointed, which quadrupeds would have found difficulty in leaping. As to\r\n'b'birds, some scarecrows, due to Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s ingenious brain, were enough\r\n'b'to frighten them. The seven hundred and fifty grains deposited in very\r\n'b'regular furrows were then left for nature to do the rest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 21st of November, Cyrus Harding began to plan the canal which was\r\n'b'to close the plateau on the west, from the south angle of Lake Grant to\r\n'b'the angle of the Mercy. There was there two or three feet of vegetable\r\n'b'earth, and below that granite. It was therefore necessary to manufacture\r\n'b'some more nitro-glycerine, and the nitro-glycerine did its accustomed\r\n'b'work. In less than a fortnight a ditch, twelve feet wide and six deep,\r\n'b'was dug out in the hard ground of the plateau. A new trench was made by\r\n'b'the same means in the rocky border of the lake, forming a small stream,\r\n'b'to which they gave the name of Creek Glycerine, and which was thus an\r\n'b'affluent of the Mercy. As the engineer had predicted, the level of the\r\n'b'lake was lowered, though very slightly. To complete the enclosure the\r\n'b'bed of the stream on the beach was considerably enlarged, and the sand\r\n'b'supported by means of stakes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'By the end of the first fortnight of December these works were finished,\r\n'b'and Prospect Heights--that is to say, a sort of irregular pentagon,\r\n'b'having a perimeter of nearly four miles, surrounded by a liquid\r\n'b'belt--was completely protected from depredators of every description.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the month of December, the heat was very great. In spite of it,\r\n'b'however, the settlers continued their work, and as they were anxious to\r\n'b'possess a poultry-yard they forthwith commenced it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is useless to say that since the enclosing of the plateau had been\r\n'b'completed, Master Jup had been set at liberty. He did not leave his\r\n'b'masters, and evinced no wish to escape. He was a gentle animal, though\r\n'b'very powerful and wonderfully active. He was already taught to make\r\n'b'himself useful by drawing loads of wood and carting away the stones\r\n'b'which were extracted from the bed of Creek Glycerine.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The poultry-yard occupied an area of two hundred square yards, on the\r\n'b'southeastern bank of the lake. It was surrounded by a palisade, and\r\n'b'in it were constructed various shelters for the birds which were to\r\n'b'populate it. These were simply built of branches and divided into\r\n'b'compartments, made ready for the expected guests.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first were the two tinamous, which were not long in having a number\r\n'b'of young ones; they had for companions half a dozen ducks, accustomed to\r\n'b'the borders of the lake. Some belonged to the Chinese species, of which\r\n'b'the wings open like a fan, and which by the brilliancy of their plumage\r\n'b'rival the golden pheasants. A few days afterwards, Herbert snared a\r\n'b'couple of gallinaceae, with spreading tails composed of long feathers,\r\n'b'magnificent alectors, which soon became tame. As to pelicans,\r\n'b'kingfishers, water-hens, they came of themselves to the shores of the\r\n'b'poultry-yard, and this little community, after some disputes, cooing,\r\n'b'screaming, clucking, ended by settling down peacefully, and increased in\r\n'b'encouraging proportion for the future use of the colony.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, wishing to complete his performance, established a\r\n'b'pigeon-house in a corner of the poultry-yard. There he lodged a dozen\r\n'b'of those pigeons which frequented the rocks of the plateau. These birds\r\n'b'soon became accustomed to returning every evening to their new dwelling,\r\n'b'and showed more disposition to domesticate themselves than their\r\n'b'congeners, the wood-pigeons.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Lastly, the time had come for turning the balloon-case to use, by\r\n'b'cutting it up to make shirts and other articles; for as to keeping it in\r\n'b'its present form, and risking themselves in a balloon filled with gas,\r\n'b'above a sea of the limits of which they had no idea, it was not to be\r\n'b'thought of.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was necessary to bring the case to Granite House, and the colonists\r\n'b'employed themselves in rendering their heavy cart lighter and more\r\n'b'manageable. But though they had a vehicle, the moving power was yet to\r\n'b'be found.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But did there not exist in the island some animal which might supply the\r\n'b'place of the horse, ass, or ox? That was the question.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9ca beast of burden would be very useful to\r\n'b'us until the captain has made a steam cart, or even an engine, for some\r\n'b'day we shall have a railroad from Granite House to Port Balloon, with a\r\n'b'branch line to Mount Franklin!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'One day, the 23rd of December, Neb and Top were heard shouting and\r\n'b'barking, each apparently trying to see who could make the most noise.\r\n'b'The settlers, who were busy at the Chimneys, ran, fearing some vexatious\r\n'b'incident.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What did they see? Two fine animals of a large size that had imprudently\r\n'b'ventured on the plateau, when the bridges were open. One would have said\r\n'b'they were horses, or at least donkeys, male and female, of a fine shape,\r\n'b'dove-colored, the legs and tail white, striped with black on the head\r\n'b'and neck. They advanced quietly without showing any uneasiness, and\r\n'b'gazed at the men, in whom they could not as yet recognize their future\r\n'b'masters.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese are onagers!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9canimals something between the zebra\r\n'b'and the quagga!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not donkeys?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause they have not long ears, and their shape is more graceful!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDonkeys or horses,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthey are \xe2\x80\x98moving powers,\xe2\x80\x99 as\r\n'b'the captain would say, and as such must be captured!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor, without frightening the animals, crept through the grass\r\n'b'to the bridge over Creek Glycerine, lowered it, and the onagers were\r\n'b'prisoners.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now, should they seize them with violence and master them by force? No.\r\n'b'It was decided that for a few days they should be allowed to roam\r\n'b'freely about the plateau, where there was an abundance of grass, and the\r\n'b'engineer immediately began to prepare a stable near the poultry-yard,\r\n'b'in which the onagers might find food, with a good litter, and shelter\r\n'b'during the night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This done, the movements of the two magnificent creatures were left\r\n'b'entirely free, and the settlers avoided even approaching them so as to\r\n'b'terrify them. Several times, however, the onagers appeared to wish to\r\n'b'leave the plateau, too confined for animals accustomed to the plains\r\n'b'and forests. They were then seen following the water-barrier which\r\n'b'everywhere presented itself before them, uttering short neighs, then\r\n'b'galloping through the grass, and becoming calmer, they would remain\r\n'b'entire hours gazing at the woods, from which they were cut off for ever!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meantime harness of vegetable fiber had been manufactured, and\r\n'b'some days after the capture of the onagers, not only the cart was ready,\r\n'b'but a straight road, or rather a cutting, had been made through the\r\n'b'forests of the Far West, from the angle of the Mercy to Port Balloon.\r\n'b'The cart might then be driven there, and towards the end of December\r\n'b'they tried the onagers for the first time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft had already coaxed the animals to come and eat out of his hand,\r\n'b'and they allowed him to approach without making any difficulty, but once\r\n'b'harnessed they reared and could with difficulty be held in. However, it\r\n'b'was not long before they submitted to this new service, for the onager,\r\n'b'being less refractory than the zebra, is frequently put in harness\r\n'b'in the mountainous regions of Southern Africa, and it has even been\r\n'b'acclimatized in Europe, under zones of a relative coolness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this day all the colony, except Pencroft who walked at the animals\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'heads, mounted the cart, and set out on the road to Port Balloon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Of course they were jolted over the somewhat rough road, but the vehicle\r\n'b'arrived without any accident, and was soon loaded with the case and\r\n'b'rigging of the balloon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock that evening the cart, after passing over the Mercy\r\n'b'bridge, descended the left bank of the river, and stopped on the beach.\r\n'b'The onagers being unharnessed, were thence led to their stable, and\r\n'b'Pencroft before going to sleep gave vent to his feelings in a deep sigh\r\n'b'of satisfaction that awoke all the echoes of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 8\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first week of January was devoted to the manufacture of the linen\r\n'b'garments required by the colony. The needles found in the box were used\r\n'b'by sturdy if not delicate fingers, and we may be sure that what was sewn\r\n'b'was sewn firmly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no lack of thread, thanks to Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s idea of\r\n'b're-employing that which had been already used in the covering of the\r\n'b'balloon. This with admirable patience was all unpicked by Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'and Herbert, for Pencroft had been obliged to give this work up, as it\r\n'b'irritated him beyond measure; but he had no equal in the sewing part\r\n'b'of the business. Indeed, everybody knows that sailors have a remarkable\r\n'b'aptitude for tailoring.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cloth of which the balloon-case was made was then cleaned by means\r\n'b'of soda and potash, obtained by the incineration of plants, in such a\r\n'b'way that the cotton, having got rid of the varnish, resumed its natural\r\n'b'softness and elasticity; then, exposed to the action of the atmosphere,\r\n'b'it soon became perfectly white. Some dozen shirts and sock--the latter\r\n'b'not knitted, of course, but made of cotton--were thus manufactured. What\r\n'b'a comfort it was to the settlers to clothe themselves again in clean\r\n'b'linen, which was doubtless rather rough, but they were not troubled\r\n'b'about that! and then to go to sleep between sheets, which made the\r\n'b'couches at Granite House into quite comfortable beds!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was about this time also that they made boots of seal-leather, which\r\n'b'were greatly needed to replace the shoes and boots brought from America.\r\n'b'We may be sure that these new shoes were large enough and never pinched\r\n'b'the feet of the wearers.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'With the beginning of the year 1866 the heat was very great, but\r\n'b'the hunting in the forests did not stand still. Agouties, peccaries,\r\n'b'capybaras, kangaroos, game of all sorts, actually swarmed there, and\r\n'b'Spilett and Herbert were too good marksmen ever to throw away their shot\r\n'b'uselessly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding still recommended them to husband the ammunition, and he\r\n'b'took measures to replace the powder and shot which had been found in\r\n'b'the box, and which he wished to reserve for the future. How did he know\r\n'b'where chance might one day cast his companions and himself in the\r\n'b'event of their leaving their domain? They should, then, prepare for the\r\n'b'unknown future by husbanding their ammunition and by substituting for it\r\n'b'some easily renewable substance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To replace lead, of which Harding had found no traces in the island, he\r\n'b'employed granulated iron, which was easy to manufacture. These bullets,\r\n'b'not having the weight of leaden bullets, were made larger, and each\r\n'b'charge contained less, but the skill of the sportsmen made up this\r\n'b'deficiency. As to powder, Cyrus Harding would have been able to make\r\n'b'that also, for he had at his disposal saltpeter, sulphur, and coal; but\r\n'b'this preparation requires extreme care, and without special tools it is\r\n'b'difficult to produce it of a good quality. Harding preferred, therefore,\r\n'b'to manufacture pyroxyle, that is to say gun-cotton, a substance in which\r\n'b'cotton is not indispensable, as the elementary tissue of vegetables may\r\n'b'be used, and this is found in an almost pure state, not only in cotton,\r\n'b'but in the textile fiber of hemp and flax, in paper, the pith of the\r\n'b'elder, etc. Now, the elder abounded in the island towards the mouth of\r\n'b'Red Creek, and the colonists had already made coffee of the berries of\r\n'b'these shrubs, which belong to the family of the caprifoliaceae.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The only thing to be collected, therefore, was elder-pith, for as to the\r\n'b'other substance necessary for the manufacture of pyroxyle, it was only\r\n'b'fuming azotic acid. Now, Harding having sulphuric acid at his disposal,\r\n'b'had already been easily able to produce azotic acid by attacking the\r\n'b'saltpeter with which nature supplied him. He accordingly resolved to\r\n'b'manufacture and employ pyroxyle, although it has some inconveniences,\r\n'b'that is to say, a great inequality of effect, an excessive\r\n'b'inflammability, since it takes fire at one hundred and seventy\r\n'b'degrees instead of two hundred and forty, and lastly, an instantaneous\r\n'b'deflagration which might damage the firearms. On the other hand, the\r\n'b'advantages of pyroxyle consist in this, that it is not injured by damp,\r\n'b'that it does not make the gun-barrels dirty, and that its force is four\r\n'b'times that of ordinary powder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To make pyroxyle, the cotton must be immersed in the fuming azotic acid\r\n'b'for a quarter of an hour, then washed in cold water and dried. Nothing\r\n'b'could be more simple.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had only at his disposal the ordinary azotic acid and not\r\n'b'the fuming or monohydrate azotic acid, that is to say, acid which emits\r\n'b'white vapors when it comes in contact with damp air; but by substituting\r\n'b'for the latter ordinary azotic acid, mixed, in the proportion of from\r\n'b'three to five volumes of concentrated sulphuric acid, the engineer\r\n'b'obtained the same result. The sportsmen of the island therefore soon\r\n'b'had a perfectly prepared substance, which, employed discreetly, produced\r\n'b'admirable results.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About this time the settlers cleared three acres of the plateau, and\r\n'b'the rest was preserved in a wild state, for the benefit of the onagers.\r\n'b'Several excursions were made into the Jacamar Wood and the forests of\r\n'b'the Far West, and they brought back from thence a large collection of\r\n'b'wild vegetables, spinach, cress, radishes, and turnips, which careful\r\n'b'culture would soon improve, and which would temper the regimen on which\r\n'b'the settlers had till then subsisted. Supplies of wood and coal were\r\n'b'also carted. Each excursion was at the same time a means of improving\r\n'b'the roads, which gradually became smoother under the wheels of the cart.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The rabbit-warren still continued to supply the larder of Granite House.\r\n'b'As fortunately it was situated on the other side of Creek Glycerine,\r\n'b'its inhabitants could not reach the plateau nor ravage the newly-made\r\n'b'plantation. The oyster-bed among the rocks was frequently renewed and\r\n'b'furnished excellent molluscs. Besides that, the fishing, either in\r\n'b'the lake or the Mercy, was very profitable, for Pencroft had made some\r\n'b'lines, armed with iron hooks, with which they frequently caught fine\r\n'b'trout, and a species of fish whose silvery sides were speckled with\r\n'b'yellow, and which were also extremely savory. Master Neb, who was\r\n'b'skilled in the culinary art, knew how to vary agreeably the bill of\r\n'b'fare. Bread alone was wanting at the table of the settlers, and as has\r\n'b'been said, they felt this privation greatly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers hunted too the turtles which frequented the shores of\r\n'b'Cape Mandible. At this place the beach was covered with little mounds,\r\n'b'concealing perfectly spherical turtles\xe2\x80\x99 eggs, with white hard shells,\r\n'b'the albumen of which does not coagulate as that of birds\xe2\x80\x99 eggs. They\r\n'b'were hatched by the sun, and their number was naturally considerable, as\r\n'b'each turtle can lay annually two hundred and fifty.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA regular egg-field,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand we have nothing to\r\n'b'do but to pick them up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But not being contented with simply the produce, they made chase after\r\n'b'the producers, the result of which was that they were able to bring back\r\n'b'to Granite House a dozen of these chelonians, which were really valuable\r\n'b'from an alimentary point of view. The turtle soup, flavored with\r\n'b'aromatic herbs, often gained well-merited praises for its preparer, Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'We must here mention another fortunate circumstance by which new stores\r\n'b'for the winter were laid in. Shoals of salmon entered the Mercy, and\r\n'b'ascended the country for several miles. It was the time at which the\r\n'b'females, going to find suitable places in which to spawn, precede the\r\n'b'males and make a great noise through the fresh water. A thousand of\r\n'b'these fish, which measured about two feet and a half in length, came up\r\n'b'the river, and a large quantity were retained by fixing dams across\r\n'b'the stream. More than a hundred were thus taken, which were salted and\r\n'b'stored for the time when winter, freezing up the streams, would render\r\n'b'fishing impracticable. By this time the intelligent Jup was raised\r\n'b'to the duty of valet. He had been dressed in a jacket, white linen\r\n'b'breeches, and an apron, the pockets of which were his delight. The\r\n'b'clever orang had been marvelously trained by Neb, and any one would have\r\n'b'said that the Negro and the ape understood each other when they talked\r\n'b'together. Jup had besides a real affection for Neb, and Neb returned\r\n'b'it. When his services were not required, either for carrying wood or for\r\n'b'climbing to the top of some tree, Jup passed the greatest part of his\r\n'b'time in the kitchen, where he endeavored to imitate Neb in all that he\r\n'b'saw him do. The black showed the greatest patience and even extreme\r\n'b'zeal in instructing his pupil, and the pupil exhibited remarkable\r\n'b'intelligence in profiting by the lessons he received from his master.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Judge then of the pleasure Master Jup gave to the inhabitants of Granite\r\n'b'House when, without their having had any idea of it, he appeared one\r\n'b'day, napkin on his arm, ready to wait at table. Quick, attentive, he\r\n'b'acquitted himself perfectly, changing the plates, bringing dishes,\r\n'b'pouring out water, all with a gravity which gave intense amusement to\r\n'b'the settlers, and which enraptured Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJup, some soup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJup, a little agouti!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJup, a plate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJup! Good Jup! Honest Jup!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nothing was heard but that, and Jup without ever being disconcerted,\r\n'b'replied to every one, watched for everything, and he shook his head in a\r\n'b'knowing way when Pencroft, referring to his joke of the first day, said\r\n'b'to him,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly, Jup, your wages must be doubled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is useless to say that the orang was now thoroughly domesticated at\r\n'b'Granite House, and that he often accompanied his masters to the forest\r\n'b'without showing any wish to leave them. It was most amusing to see him\r\n'b'walking with a stick which Pencroft had given him, and which he carried\r\n'b'on his shoulder like a gun. If they wished to gather some fruit from\r\n'b'the summit of a tree, how quickly he climbed for it. If the wheel of the\r\n'b'cart stuck in the mud, with what energy did Jup with a single heave of\r\n'b'his shoulder put it right again.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a jolly fellow he is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft often. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he was as\r\n'b'mischievous as he is good, there would be no doing anything with him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was towards the end of January the colonists began their labors in\r\n'b'the center of the island. It had been decided that a corral should be\r\n'b'established near the sources of the Red Creek, at the foot of Mount\r\n'b'Franklin, destined to contain the ruminants, whose presence would have\r\n'b'been troublesome at Granite House, and especially for the musmons, who\r\n'b'were to supply the wool for the settlers\xe2\x80\x99 winter garments.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Each morning, the colony, sometimes entire, but more often represented\r\n'b'only by Harding, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to the sources of the\r\n'b'Creek, a distance of not more than five miles, by the newly beaten road\r\n'b'to which the name of Corral Road had been given.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There a site was chosen, at the back of the southern ridge of the\r\n'b'mountain. It was a meadow land, dotted here and there with clumps of\r\n'b'trees, and watered by a little stream, which sprung from the slopes\r\n'b'which closed it in on one side. The grass was fresh, and it was not\r\n'b'too much shaded by the trees which grew about it. This meadow was to\r\n'b'be surrounded by a palisade, high enough to prevent even the most agile\r\n'b'animals from leaping over. This enclosure would be large enough to\r\n'b'contain a hundred musmons and wild goats, with all the young ones they\r\n'b'might produce.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The perimeter of the corral was then traced by the engineer, and\r\n'b'they would then have proceeded to fell the trees necessary for the\r\n'b'construction of the palisade, but as the opening up of the road had\r\n'b'already necessitated the sacrifice of a considerable number, those were\r\n'b'brought and supplied a hundred stakes, which were firmly fixed in the\r\n'b'ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The construction of this corral did not take less than three weeks,\r\n'b'for besides the palisade, Cyrus Harding built large sheds, in which the\r\n'b'animals could take shelter. These buildings had also to be made very\r\n'b'strong, for musmons are powerful animals, and their first fury was to be\r\n'b'feared. The stakes, sharpened at their upper end and hardened by fire,\r\n'b'had been fixed by means of cross-bars, and at regular distances props\r\n'b'assured the solidity of the whole.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The corral finished, a raid had to be made on the pastures frequented\r\n'b'by the ruminants. This was done on the 7th of February, on a beautiful\r\n'b'summer\xe2\x80\x99s day, and every one took part in it. The onagers, already well\r\n'b'trained, were ridden by Spilett and Herbert, and were of great use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The maneuver consisted simply in surrounding the musmons and goats, and\r\n'b'gradually narrowing the circle around them. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft,\r\n'b'Neb, and Jup, posted themselves in different parts of the wood, while\r\n'b'the two cavaliers and Top galloped in a radius of half a mile round the\r\n'b'corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The musmons were very numerous in this part of the island. These fine\r\n'b'animals were as large as deer; their horns were stronger than those of\r\n'b'the ram, and their gray-colored fleece was mixed with long hair.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This hunting day was very fatiguing. Such going and coming, and running\r\n'b'and riding and shouting! Of a hundred musmons which had been surrounded,\r\n'b'more than two-thirds escaped, but at last, thirty of these animals and\r\n'b'ten wild goats were gradually driven back towards the corral, the open\r\n'b'door of which appearing to offer a means of escape, they rushed in and\r\n'b'were prisoners.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In short, the result was satisfactory, and the settlers had no reason to\r\n'b'complain. There was no doubt that the flock would prosper, and that at\r\n'b'no distant time not only wool but hides would be abundant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That evening the hunters returned to Granite House quite exhausted.\r\n'b'However, notwithstanding their fatigue, they returned the next day\r\n'b'to visit the corral. The prisoners had been trying to overthrow the\r\n'b'palisade, but of course had not succeeded, and were not long in becoming\r\n'b'more tranquil.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the month of February, no event of any importance occurred. The\r\n'b'daily labors were pursued methodically, and, as well as improving the\r\n'b'roads to the corral and to Port Balloon, a third was commenced, which,\r\n'b'starting from the enclosure, proceeded towards the western coast. The\r\n'b'yet unknown portion of Lincoln Island was that of the wood-covered\r\n'b'Serpentine Peninsula, which sheltered the wild beasts, from which Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett was so anxious to clear their domain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Before the cold season should appear the most assiduous care was given\r\n'b'to the cultivation of the wild plants which had been transplanted from\r\n'b'the forest to Prospect Heights. Herbert never returned from an excursion\r\n'b'without bringing home some useful vegetable. One day, it was some\r\n'b'specimens of the chicory tribe, the seeds of which by pressure yield an\r\n'b'excellent oil; another, it was some common sorrel, whose antiscorbutic\r\n'b'qualities were not to be despised; then, some of those precious tubers,\r\n'b'which have at all times been cultivated in South America, potatoes, of\r\n'b'which more than two hundred species are now known. The kitchen garden,\r\n'b'now well stocked and carefully defended from the birds, was divided\r\n'b'into small beds, where grew lettuces, kidney potatoes, sorrel, turnips,\r\n'b'radishes, and other coneiferae. The soil on the plateau was particularly\r\n'b'fertile, and it was hoped that the harvests would be abundant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had also a variety of different beverages, and so long as they did\r\n'b'not demand wine, the most hard to please would have had no reason to\r\n'b'complain. To the Oswego tea, and the fermented liquor extracted from the\r\n'b'roots of the dragonnier, Harding had added a regular beer, made from\r\n'b'the young shoots of the spruce-fir, which, after having been boiled\r\n'b'and fermented, made that agreeable drink called by the Anglo-Americans\r\n'b'spring-beer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards the end of the summer, the poultry-yard was possessed of\r\n'b'a couple of fine bustards, which belonged to the houbara species,\r\n'b'characterized by a sort of feathery mantle; a dozen shovelers, whose\r\n'b'upper mandible was prolonged on each side by a membraneous appendage;\r\n'b'and also some magnificent cocks, similar to the Mozambique cocks,\r\n'b'the comb, caruncle, and epidermis being black. So far, everything had\r\n'b'succeeded, thanks to the activity of these courageous and intelligent\r\n'b'men. Nature did much for them, doubtless; but faithful to the great\r\n'b'precept, they made a right use of what a bountiful Providence gave them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After the heat of these warm summer days, in the evening when their work\r\n'b'was finished and the sea-breeze began to blow, they liked to sit on the\r\n'b'edge of Prospect Heights, in a sort of veranda, covered with creepers,\r\n'b'which Neb had made with his own hands. There they talked, they\r\n'b'instructed each other, they made plans, and the rough good-humor of\r\n'b'the sailor always amused this little world, in which the most perfect\r\n'b'harmony had never ceased to reign.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They often spoke of their country, of their dear and great America. What\r\n'b'was the result of the War of Secession? It could not have been greatly\r\n'b'prolonged. Richmond had doubtless soon fallen into the hands of General\r\n'b'Grant. The taking of the capital of the Confederates must have been the\r\n'b'last action of this terrible struggle. Now the North had triumphed in\r\n'b'the good cause, how welcome would have been a newspaper to the exiles in\r\n'b'Lincoln Island! For eleven months all communication between them and the\r\n'b'rest of their fellow-creatures had been interrupted, and in a short time\r\n'b'the 24th of March would arrive, the anniversary of the day on which\r\n'b'the balloon had thrown them on this unknown coast. They were then mere\r\n'b'castaways, not even knowing how they should preserve their miserable\r\n'b'lives from the fury of the elements! And now, thanks to the knowledge of\r\n'b'their captain, and their own intelligence, they were regular colonists,\r\n'b'furnished with arms, tools, and instruments; they had been able to turn\r\n'b'to their profit the animals, plants, and minerals of the island, that is\r\n'b'to say, the three kingdoms of Nature.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Yes; they often talked of all these things and formed still more plans.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to Cyrus Harding he was for the most part silent, and listened to\r\n'b'his companions more often than he spoke to them. Sometimes he smiled\r\n'b'at Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s ideas or Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s nonsense, but always and everywhere he\r\n'b'pondered over those inexplicable facts, that strange enigma, of which\r\n'b'the secret still escaped him!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 9\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The weather changed during the first week of March. There had been a\r\n'b'full moon at the commencement of the month, and the heat was excessive.\r\n'b'The atmosphere was felt to be full of electricity, and a period of some\r\n'b'length of tempestuous weather was to be feared.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Indeed, on the 2nd, peals of thunder were heard, the wind blew from the\r\n'b'east, and hail rattled against the facade of Granite House like\r\n'b'volleys of grape-shot. The door and windows were immediately closed,\r\n'b'or everything in the rooms would have been drenched. On seeing these\r\n'b'hailstones, some of which were the size of a pigeon\xe2\x80\x99s egg, Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'first thought was that his cornfield was in serious danger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He directly rushed to his field, where little green heads were already\r\n'b'appearing, and by means of a great cloth, he managed to protect his\r\n'b'crop.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This bad weather lasted a week, during which time the thunder rolled\r\n'b'without cessation in the depths of the sky.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists, not having any pressing work out of doors, profited\r\n'b'by the bad weather to work at the interior of Granite House, the\r\n'b'arrangement of which was becoming more complete from day to day. The\r\n'b'engineer made a turning-lathe, with which he turned several articles\r\n'b'both for the toilet and the kitchen, particularly buttons, the want of\r\n'b'which was greatly felt. A gunrack had been made for the firearms, which\r\n'b'were kept with extreme care, and neither tables nor cupboards were left\r\n'b'incomplete. They sawed, they planed, they filed, they turned; and during\r\n'b'the whole of this bad season, nothing was heard but the grinding\r\n'b'of tools or the humming of the turning-lathe which responded to the\r\n'b'growling of the thunder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Master Jup had not been forgotten, and he occupied a room at the back,\r\n'b'near the storeroom, a sort of cabin with a cot always full of good\r\n'b'litter, which perfectly suited his taste.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith good old Jup there is never any quarreling,\xe2\x80\x9d often repeated\r\n'b'Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cnever any improper reply. What a servant, Neb, what a\r\n'b'servant!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Of course Jup was now well used to service. He brushed their clothes,\r\n'b'he turned the spit, he waited at table, he swept the rooms, he gathered\r\n'b'wood, and he performed another admirable piece of service which\r\n'b'delighted Pencroft--he never went to sleep without first coming to tuck\r\n'b'up the worthy sailor in his bed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the health of the members of the colony, bipeds or bimana,\r\n'b'quadrumana or quadrupeds, it left nothing to be desired. With their life\r\n'b'in the open air, on this salubrious soil, under that temperate zone,\r\n'b'working both with head and hands, they could not suppose that illness\r\n'b'would ever attack them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All were indeed wonderfully well. Herbert had already grown two inches\r\n'b'in the year. His figure was forming and becoming more manly, and he\r\n'b'promised to be an accomplished man, physically as well as morally.\r\n'b'Besides he improved himself during the leisure hours which manual\r\n'b'occupations left to him; he read the books found in the case; and after\r\n'b'the practical lessons which were taught by the very necessity of their\r\n'b'position, he found in the engineer for science, and the reporter for\r\n'b'languages, masters who were delighted to complete his education.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The tempest ended about the 9th of March, but the sky remained covered\r\n'b'with clouds during the whole of this last summer month. The atmosphere,\r\n'b'violently agitated by the electric commotions, could not recover its\r\n'b'former purity, and there was almost invariably rain and fog, except for\r\n'b'three or four fine days on which several excursions were made. About\r\n'b'this time the female onager gave birth to a young one which belonged to\r\n'b'the same sex as its mother, and which throve capitally. In the corral,\r\n'b'the flock of musmons had also increased, and several lambs already\r\n'b'bleated in the sheds, to the great delight of Neb and Herbert, who had\r\n'b'each their favorite among these newcomers. An attempt was also made\r\n'b'for the domestication of the peccaries, which succeeded well. A sty was\r\n'b'constructed under the poultry-yard, and soon contained several young\r\n'b'ones in the way to become civilized, that is to say, to become fat\r\n'b'under Neb\xe2\x80\x99s care. Master Jup, entrusted with carrying them their\r\n'b'daily nourishment, leavings from the kitchen, etc., acquitted himself\r\n'b'conscientiously of his task. He sometimes amused himself at the expense\r\n'b'of his little pensioners by tweaking their tails; but this was mischief,\r\n'b'and not wickedness, for these little twisted tails amused him like a\r\n'b'plaything, and his instinct was that of a child. One day in this month\r\n'b'of March, Pencroft, talking to the engineer, reminded Cyrus Harding of a\r\n'b'promise which the latter had not as yet had time to fulfil.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou once spoke of an apparatus which would take the place of the long\r\n'b'ladders at Granite House, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cwon\xe2\x80\x99t you make it some\r\n'b'day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing will be easier; but is this a really useful thing?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, captain. After we have given ourselves necessaries, let us\r\n'b'think a little of luxury. For us it may be luxury, if you like, but\r\n'b'for things it is necessary. It isn\xe2\x80\x99t very convenient to climb up a long\r\n'b'ladder when one is heavily loaded.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pencroft, we will try to please you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut you have no machine at your disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will make one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA steam machine?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, a water machine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, indeed, to work his apparatus there was already a natural force\r\n'b'at the disposal of the engineer which could be used without great\r\n'b'difficulty. For this, it was enough to augment the flow of the little\r\n'b'stream which supplied the interior of Granite House with water. The\r\n'b'opening among the stones and grass was then increased, thus producing\r\n'b'a strong fall at the bottom of the passage, the overflow from which\r\n'b'escaped by the inner well. Below this fall the engineer fixed a cylinder\r\n'b'with paddles, which was joined on the exterior with a strong cable\r\n'b'rolled on a wheel, supporting a basket. In this way, by means of a long\r\n'b'rope reaching to the ground, which enabled them to regulate the motive\r\n'b'power, they could rise in the basket to the door of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was on the 17th of March that the lift acted for the first time, and\r\n'b'gave universal satisfaction. Henceforward all the loads, wood, coal,\r\n'b'provisions, and even the settlers themselves, were hoisted by this\r\n'b'simple system, which replaced the primitive ladder, and, as may be\r\n'b'supposed, no one thought of regretting the change. Top particularly was\r\n'b'enchanted with this improvement, for he had not, and never could have\r\n'b'possessed Master Jup\xe2\x80\x99s skill in climbing ladders, and often it was on\r\n'b'Neb\xe2\x80\x99s back, or even on that of the orang that he had been obliged to\r\n'b'make the ascent to Granite House. About this time, too, Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'attempted to manufacture glass, and he at first put the old pottery-kiln\r\n'b'to this new use. There were some difficulties to be encountered; but,\r\n'b'after several fruitless attempts, he succeeded in setting up a glass\r\n'b'manufactory, which Gideon Spilett and Herbert, his usual assistants, did\r\n'b'not leave for several days. As to the substances used in the composition\r\n'b'of glass, they are simply sand, chalk, and soda, either carbonate or\r\n'b'sulphate. Now the beach supplied sand, lime supplied chalk, sea-weeds\r\n'b'supplied soda, pyrites supplied sulphuric acid, and the ground supplied\r\n'b'coal to heat the kiln to the wished-for temperature. Cyrus Harding thus\r\n'b'soon had everything ready for setting to work.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The tool, the manufacture of which presented the most difficulty, was\r\n'b'the pipe of the glass-maker, an iron tube, five or six feet long, which\r\n'b'collects on one end the material in a state of fusion. But by means of\r\n'b'a long, thin piece of iron rolled up like the barrel of a gun, Pencroft\r\n'b'succeeded in making a tube soon ready for use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 28th of March the tube was heated. A hundred parts of sand,\r\n'b'thirty-five of chalk, forty of sulphate of soda, mixed with two or three\r\n'b'parts of powdered coal, composed the substance, which was placed in\r\n'b'crucibles. When the high temperature of the oven had reduced it to a\r\n'b'liquid, or rather a pasty state, Cyrus Harding collected with the tube\r\n'b'a quantity of the paste: he turned it about on a metal plate, previously\r\n'b'arranged, so as to give it a form suitable for blowing, then he passed\r\n'b'the tube to Herbert, telling him to blow at the other extremity.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Herbert, swelling out his cheeks, blew so much and so well into the\r\n'b'tube-taking care to twirl it round at the same time--that his breath\r\n'b'dilated the glassy mass. Other quantities of the substance in a state\r\n'b'of fusion were added to the first, and in a short time the result was a\r\n'b'bubble which measured a foot in diameter. Harding then took the tube\r\n'b'out of Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s hands, and, giving it a pendulous motion, he ended by\r\n'b'lengthening the malleable bubble so as to give it a cylindroconic shape.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The blowing operation had given a cylinder of glass terminated by two\r\n'b'hemispheric caps, which were easily detached by means of a sharp iron\r\n'b'dipped in cold water; then, by the same proceeding, this cylinder was\r\n'b'cut lengthways, and after having been rendered malleable by a second\r\n'b'heating, it was extended on a plate and spread out with a wooden roller.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first pane was thus manufactured, and they had only to perform this\r\n'b'operation fifty times to have fifty panes. The windows at Granite House\r\n'b'were soon furnished with panes; not very white, perhaps, but still\r\n'b'sufficiently transparent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to bottles and tumblers, that was only play. They were satisfied with\r\n'b'them, besides, just as they came from the end of the tube. Pencroft had\r\n'b'asked to be allowed to \xe2\x80\x9cblow\xe2\x80\x9d in his turn, and it was great fun for\r\n'b'him; but he blew so hard that his productions took the most ridiculous\r\n'b'shapes, which he admired immensely.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Herbert, while hunting one day, had entered the forest\r\n'b'of the Far West, on the left bank of the Mercy, and, as usual, the\r\n'b'lad was asking a thousand questions of the engineer, who answered them\r\n'b'heartily. Now, as Harding was not a sportsman, and as, on the other\r\n'b'side, Herbert was talking chemistry and natural philosophy, numbers of\r\n'b'kangaroos, capybaras, and agouties came within range, which, however,\r\n'b'escaped the lad\xe2\x80\x99s gun; the consequence was that the day was already\r\n'b'advanced, and the two hunters were in danger of having made a\r\n'b'useless excursion, when Herbert, stopping, and uttering a cry of joy,\r\n'b'exclaimed,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Captain Harding, do you see that tree?\xe2\x80\x9d and he pointed to a shrub,\r\n'b'rather than a tree, for it was composed of a single stem, covered with a\r\n'b'scaly bark, which bore leaves streaked with little parallel veins.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is this tree which resembles a little palm?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a \xe2\x80\x98cycas revoluta,\xe2\x80\x99 of which I have a picture in our dictionary\r\n'b'of Natural History!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I can\xe2\x80\x99t see any fruit on this shrub!\xe2\x80\x9d observed his companion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut its stem contains a flour with\r\n'b'which nature has provided us all ready ground.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is, then, the bread-tree?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the bread-tree.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a valuable discovery,\r\n'b'since our wheat harvest is not yet ripe; I hope that you are not\r\n'b'mistaken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert was not mistaken: he broke the stem of a cycas, which was\r\n'b'composed of a glandulous tissue, containing a quantity of floury pith,\r\n'b'traversed with woody fiber, separated by rings of the same substance,\r\n'b'arranged concentrically. With this fecula was mingled a mucilaginous\r\n'b'juice of disagreeable flavor, but which it would be easy to get rid of\r\n'b'by pressure. This cellular substance was regular flour of a superior\r\n'b'quality, extremely nourishing; its exportation was formerly forbidden by\r\n'b'the Japanese laws.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Herbert, after having examined that part of the Far\r\n'b'West where the cycas grew, took their bearings, and returned to Granite\r\n'b'House, where they made known their discovery.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day the settlers went to collect some, and returned to Granite\r\n'b'House with an ample supply of cycas stems. The engineer constructed a\r\n'b'press, with which to extract the mucilaginous juice mingled with the\r\n'b'fecula, and he obtained a large quantity of flour, which Neb soon\r\n'b'transformed into cakes and puddings. This was not quite real wheaten\r\n'b'bread, but it was very like it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now, too, the onager, the goats, and the sheep in the corral furnished\r\n'b'daily the milk necessary to the colony. The cart, or rather a sort of\r\n'b'light carriole which had replaced it, made frequent journeys to the\r\n'b'corral, and when it was Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s turn to go he took Jup, and let him\r\n'b'drive, and Jup, cracking his whip, acquitted himself with his customary\r\n'b'intelligence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Everything prospered, as well in the corral as in Granite House, and\r\n'b'certainly the settlers, if it had not been that they were so far from\r\n'b'their native land, had no reason to complain. They were so well suited\r\n'b'to this life, and were, besides, so accustomed to the island, that they\r\n'b'could not have left its hospitable soil without regret!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And yet so deeply is the love of his country implanted in the heart of\r\n'b'man, that if a ship had unexpectedly come in sight of the island, the\r\n'b'colonists would have made signals, would have attracted her attention,\r\n'b'and would have departed!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the 1st of April, a Sunday, Easter Day, which Harding and his\r\n'b'companions sanctified by rest and prayer. The day was fine, such as an\r\n'b'October day in the Northern Hemisphere might be.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All, towards the evening after dinner, were seated under the veranda\r\n'b'on the edge of Prospect Heights, and they were watching the\r\n'b'darkness creeping up from the horizon. Some cups of the infusion of\r\n'b'elder-berries, which took the place of coffee, had been served by Neb.\r\n'b'They were speaking of the island and of its isolated situation in the\r\n'b'Pacific, which led Gideon Spilett to say,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Cyrus, have you ever, since you possessed the sextant found in\r\n'b'the case, again taken the position of our island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut it would perhaps be a good thing to do it with this instrument,\r\n'b'which is more perfect than that which you before used.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the good?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cThe island is quite comfortable\r\n'b'where it is!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, who knows,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cwho knows but that we may be\r\n'b'much nearer inhabited land than we think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall know to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand if it had not\r\n'b'been for the occupations which left me no leisure, we should have known\r\n'b'it already.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cThe captain is too good an observer to be\r\n'b'mistaken, and, if it has not moved from its place, the island is just\r\n'b'where he put it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the next day, therefore, by means of the sextant, the engineer made\r\n'b'the necessary observations to verify the position which he had\r\n'b'already obtained, and this was the result of his operation. His first\r\n'b'observation had given him the situation of Lincoln Island,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In west longitude: from 150deg. to 155deg.;\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In south latitude: from 30deg. to 35deg.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The second gave exactly:\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In longitude: 150deg. 30\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In south latitude: 34deg. 57\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So then, notwithstanding the imperfection of his apparatus, Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding had operated with so much skill that his error did not exceed\r\n'b'five degrees.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9csince we possess an atlas as well as a\r\n'b'sextant, let us see, my dear Cyrus, the exact position which Lincoln\r\n'b'Island occupies in the Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert fetched the atlas, and the map of the Pacific was opened, and\r\n'b'the engineer, compass in hand, prepared to determine their position.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Suddenly the compasses stopped, and he exclaimed,\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut an island exists in this part of the Pacific already!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn island?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTabor Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn important island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, an islet lost in the Pacific, and which perhaps has never been\r\n'b'visited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will visit it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, captain. We will build a decked boat, and I will undertake to\r\n'b'steer her. At what distance are we from this Tabor Island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout a hundred and fifty miles to the northeast,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA hundred and fifty miles! And what\xe2\x80\x99s that?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cIn\r\n'b'forty-eight hours, with a good wind, we should sight it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, on this reply, it was decided that a vessel should be constructed\r\n'b'in time to be launched towards the month of next October, on the return\r\n'b'of the fine season.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 10\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When Pencroft had once got a plan in his head, he had no peace till it\r\n'b'was executed. Now he wished to visit Tabor Island, and as a boat of a\r\n'b'certain size was necessary for this voyage, he determined to build one.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What wood should he employ? Elm or fir, both of which abounded in the\r\n'b'island? They decided for the fir, as being easy to work, but which\r\n'b'stands water as well as the elm.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These details settled, it was agreed that since the fine season would\r\n'b'not return before six months, Cyrus Harding and Pencroft should work\r\n'b'alone at the boat. Gideon Spilett and Herbert were to continue to\r\n'b'hunt, and neither Neb nor Master Jup, his assistant, were to leave the\r\n'b'domestic duties which had devolved upon them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Directly the trees were chosen, they were felled, stripped of their\r\n'b'branches, and sawn into planks as well as sawyers would have been able\r\n'b'to do it. A week after, in the recess between the Chimneys and the\r\n'b'cliff, a dockyard was prepared, and a keel five-and-thirty feet long,\r\n'b'furnished with a stern-post at the stern and a stem at the bows, lay\r\n'b'along the sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding was not working in the dark at this new trade. He knew as\r\n'b'much about ship-building as about nearly everything else, and he had\r\n'b'at first drawn the model of his ship on paper. Besides, he was ably\r\n'b'seconded by Pencroft, who, having worked for several years in a dockyard\r\n'b'in Brooklyn, knew the practical part of the trade. It was not until\r\n'b'after careful calculation and deep thought that the timbers were laid on\r\n'b'the keel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, as may be believed, was all eagerness to carry out his new\r\n'b'enterprise, and would not leave his work for an instant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A single thing had the honor of drawing him, but for one day only, from\r\n'b'his dockyard. This was the second wheat-harvest, which was gathered in\r\n'b'on the 15th of April. It was as much a success as the first, and yielded\r\n'b'the number of grains which had been predicted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFive bushels, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, after having scrupulously\r\n'b'measured his treasure.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFive bushels,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cand a hundred and thirty thousand\r\n'b'grains a bushel will make six hundred and fifty thousand grains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we will sow them all this time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cexcept a\r\n'b'little in reserve.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pencroft, and if the next crop gives a proportionate yield, we\r\n'b'shall have four thousand bushels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd shall we eat bread?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall eat bread.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut we must have a mill.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will make one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The third corn-field was very much larger than the two first, and the\r\n'b'soil, prepared with extreme care, received the precious seed. That done,\r\n'b'Pencroft returned to his work.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this time Spilett and Herbert hunted in the neighborhood, and\r\n'b'they ventured deep into the still unknown parts of the Far West, their\r\n'b'guns loaded with ball, ready for any dangerous emergency. It was a vast\r\n'b'thicket of magnificent trees, crowded together as if pressed for room.\r\n'b'The exploration of these dense masses of wood was difficult in\r\n'b'the extreme, and the reporter never ventured there without the\r\n'b'pocket-compass, for the sun scarcely pierced through the thick foliage\r\n'b'and it would have been very difficult for them to retrace their way.\r\n'b'It naturally happened that game was more rare in those situations where\r\n'b'there was hardly sufficient room to move; two or three large herbivorous\r\n'b'animals were however killed during the last fortnight of April. These\r\n'b'were koalas, specimens of which the settlers had already seen to the\r\n'b'north of the lake, and which stupidly allowed themselves to be killed\r\n'b'among the thick branches of the trees in which they took refuge. Their\r\n'b'skins were brought back to Granite House, and there, by the help of\r\n'b'sulphuric acid, they were subjected to a sort of tanning process which\r\n'b'rendered them capable of being used.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 30th of April, the two sportsmen were in the depth of the Far\r\n'b'West, when the reporter, preceding Herbert a few paces, arrived in\r\n'b'a sort of clearing, into which the trees more sparsely scattered had\r\n'b'permitted a few rays to penetrate. Gideon Spilett was at first surprised\r\n'b'at the odor which exhaled from certain plants with straight stalks,\r\n'b'round and branchy, bearing grape-like clusters of flowers and very small\r\n'b'berries. The reporter broke off one or two of these stalks and returned\r\n'b'to the lad, to whom he said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can this be, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is a treasure which will secure\r\n'b'you Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s gratitude forever.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs it tobacco?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and though it may not be of the first quality, it is none the less\r\n'b'tobacco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, good old Pencroft! Won\xe2\x80\x99t he be pleased! But we must not let him\r\n'b'smoke it all, he must give us our share.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh! an idea occurs to me, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t let us\r\n'b'say anything to Pencroft yet; we will prepare these leaves, and one fine\r\n'b'day we will present him with a pipe already filled!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll right, Herbert, and on that day our worthy companion will have\r\n'b'nothing left to wish for in this world.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter and the lad secured a good store of the precious plant, and\r\n'b'then returned to Granite House, where they smuggled it in with as much\r\n'b'precaution as if Pencroft had been the most vigilant and severe of\r\n'b'custom-house officers.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Neb were taken into confidence, and the sailor\r\n'b'suspected nothing during the whole time, necessarily somewhat long,\r\n'b'which was required in order to dry the small leaves, chop them up, and\r\n'b'subject them to a certain torrefaction on hot stones. This took two\r\n'b'months; but all these manipulations were successfully carried on unknown\r\n'b'to Pencroft, for, occupied with the construction of his boat, he only\r\n'b'returned to Granite House at the hour of rest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For some days they had observed an enormous animal two or three miles\r\n'b'out in the open sea swimming around Lincoln Island. This was a whale\r\n'b'of the largest size, which apparently belonged to the southern species,\r\n'b'called the \xe2\x80\x9cCape Whale.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a lucky chance it would be if we could capture it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the\r\n'b'sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! if we only had a proper boat and a good harpoon, I would\r\n'b'say \xe2\x80\x98After the beast,\xe2\x80\x99 for he would be well worth the trouble of\r\n'b'catching!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cI should much like to watch you\r\n'b'handling a harpoon. It would be very interesting.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am astonished,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cto see a whale in this\r\n'b'comparatively high latitude.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so, Mr. Spilett?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cWe are exactly in that part of\r\n'b'the Pacific which English and American whalemen call the whale field,\r\n'b'and it is here, between New Zealand and South America, that the whales\r\n'b'of the Southern Hemisphere are met with in the greatest numbers.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Pencroft returned to his work, not without uttering a sigh of\r\n'b'regret, for every sailor is a born fisherman, and if the pleasure of\r\n'b'fishing is in exact proportion to the size of the animal, one can judge\r\n'b'how a whaler feels in sight of a whale. And if this had only been for\r\n'b'pleasure! But they could not help feeling how valuable such a prize\r\n'b'would have been to the colony, for the oil, fat, and bones would have\r\n'b'been put to many uses.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now it happened that this whale appeared to have no wish to leave the\r\n'b'waters of the island. Therefore, whether from the windows of Granite\r\n'b'House, or from Prospect Heights, Herbert and Gideon Spilett, when they\r\n'b'were not hunting, or Neb, unless presiding over his fires, never left\r\n'b'the telescope, but watched all the animal\xe2\x80\x99s movements. The cetacean,\r\n'b'having entered far into Union Bay, made rapid furrows across it from\r\n'b'Mandible Cape to Claw Cape, propelled by its enormously powerful flukes,\r\n'b'on which it supported itself, and making its way through the water\r\n'b'at the rate little short of twelve knots. Sometimes also it\r\n'b'approached so near to the island that it could be clearly distinguished.\r\n'b'It was the southern whale, which is completely black, the head being\r\n'b'more depressed than that of the northern whale.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They could also see it throwing up from its air-holes to a great\r\n'b'height a cloud of vapor, or of water, for, strange as it may appear,\r\n'b'naturalists and whalers are not agreed on this subject. Is it air or is\r\n'b'it water which is thus driven out? It is generally admitted to be vapor,\r\n'b'which, condensing suddenly by contact with the cold air, falls again as\r\n'b'rain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the presence of this mammifer preoccupied the colonists. It\r\n'b'irritated Pencroft especially, as he could think of nothing else while\r\n'b'at work. He ended by longing for it, like a child for a thing which it\r\n'b'has been denied. At night he talked about it in his sleep, and certainly\r\n'b'if he had had the means of attacking it, if the sloop had been in a fit\r\n'b'state to put to sea, he would not have hesitated to set out in pursuit.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But what the colonists could not do for themselves chance did for them,\r\n'b'and on the 3rd of May shouts from Neb, who had stationed himself at the\r\n'b'kitchen window, announced that the whale was stranded on the beach of\r\n'b'the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert and Gideon Spilett, who were just about to set out hunting,\r\n'b'left their guns, Pencroft threw down his ax, and Harding and Neb joining\r\n'b'their companions, all rushed towards the scene of action.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranding had taken place on the beach of Flotsam Point, three miles\r\n'b'from Granite House, and at high tide. It was therefore probable that the\r\n'b'cetacean would not be able to extricate itself easily; at any rate it\r\n'b'was best to hasten, so as to cut off its retreat if necessary. They ran\r\n'b'with pick-axes and iron-tipped poles in their hands, passed over the\r\n'b'Mercy bridge, descended the right bank of the river, along the beach,\r\n'b'and in less than twenty minutes the settlers were close to the enormous\r\n'b'animal, above which flocks of birds already hovered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a monster!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the exclamation was natural, for it was a southern whale, eighty\r\n'b'feet long, a giant of the species, probably not weighing less than a\r\n'b'hundred and fifty thousand pounds!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, the monster thus stranded did not move, nor attempt by\r\n'b'struggling to regain the water while the tide was still high.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was dead, and a harpoon was sticking out of its left side.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere are whalers in these quarters, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'directly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, Mr. Spilett, that doesn\xe2\x80\x99t prove anything!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhales have been known to go thousands of miles with a harpoon in\r\n'b'the side, and this one might even have been struck in the north of the\r\n'b'Atlantic and come to die in the south of the Pacific, and it would be\r\n'b'nothing astonishing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, having torn the harpoon from the animal\xe2\x80\x99s side, read this\r\n'b'inscription on it:\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'           MARIA STELLA, VINEYARD\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA vessel from the Vineyard! A ship from my country!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cThe\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Maria Stella!\xe2\x80\x99 A fine whaler, \xe2\x80\x98pon my word; I know her well! Oh, my\r\n'b'friends, a vessel from the Vineyard!--a whaler from the Vineyard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor brandishing the harpoon, repeated, not without emotion,\r\n'b'the name which he loved so well--the name of his birthplace.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But as it could not be expected that the \xe2\x80\x9cMaria Stella\xe2\x80\x9d would come to\r\n'b'reclaim the animal harpooned by her, they resolved to begin cutting it\r\n'b'up before decomposition should commence. The birds, who had watched\r\n'b'this rich prey for several days, had determined to take possession of it\r\n'b'without further delay, and it was necessary to drive them off by firing\r\n'b'at them repeatedly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The whale was a female, and a large quantity of milk was taken from it,\r\n'b'which, according to the opinion of the naturalist Duffenbach, might pass\r\n'b'for cow\xe2\x80\x99s milk, and, indeed, it differs from it neither in taste, color,\r\n'b'nor density.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft had formerly served on board a whaling-ship, and he could\r\n'b'methodically direct the operation of cutting up, a sufficiently\r\n'b'disagreeable operation lasting three days, but from which the settlers\r\n'b'did not flinch, not even Gideon Spilett, who, as the sailor said, would\r\n'b'end by making a \xe2\x80\x9creal good castaway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The blubber, cut in parallel slices of two feet and a half in thickness,\r\n'b'then divided into pieces which might weigh about a thousand pounds each,\r\n'b'was melted down in large earthen pots brought to the spot, for they did\r\n'b'not wish to taint the environs of Granite House, and in this fusion it\r\n'b'lost nearly a third of its weight.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But there was an immense quantity of it; the tongue alone yielded six\r\n'b'thousand pounds of oil, and the lower lip four thousand. Then, besides\r\n'b'the fat, which would insure for a long time a store of stearine and\r\n'b'glycerine, there were still the bones, for which a use could doubtless\r\n'b'be found, although there were neither umbrellas nor stays used at\r\n'b'Granite House. The upper part of the mouth of the cetacean was, indeed,\r\n'b'provided on both sides with eight hundred horny blades, very elastic,\r\n'b'of a fibrous texture, and fringed at the edge like great combs, at which\r\n'b'the teeth, six feet long, served to retain the thousands of animalculae,\r\n'b'little fish, and molluscs, on which the whale fed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The operation finished, to the great satisfaction of the operators, the\r\n'b'remains of the animal were left to the birds, who would soon make every\r\n'b'vestige of it disappear, and their usual daily occupations were resumed\r\n'b'by the inmates of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, before returning to the dockyard, Cyrus Harding conceived\r\n'b'the idea of fabricating certain machines, which greatly excited the\r\n'b'curiosity of his companions. He took a dozen of the whale\xe2\x80\x99s bones, cut\r\n'b'them into six equal parts, and sharpened their ends.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis machine is not my own invention, and it is frequently employed\r\n'b'by the Aleutian hunters in Russian America. You see these bones, my\r\n'b'friends; well, when it freezes, I will bend them, and then wet them\r\n'b'with water till they are entirely covered with ice, which will keep them\r\n'b'bent, and I will strew them on the snow, having previously covered them\r\n'b'with fat. Now, what will happen if a hungry animal swallows one of these\r\n'b'baits? Why, the heat of his stomach will melt the ice, and the bone,\r\n'b'springing straight, will pierce him with its sharp points.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell! I do call that ingenious!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it will spare the powder and shot,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat will be better than traps!\xe2\x80\x9d added Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile the boat-building progressed, and towards the end of\r\n'b'the month half the planking was completed. It could already be seen that\r\n'b'her shape was excellent, and that she would sail well.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft worked with unparalleled ardor, and only a sturdy frame could\r\n'b'have borne such fatigue; but his companions were preparing in secret a\r\n'b'reward for his labors, and on the 31st of May he was to meet with one of\r\n'b'the greatest joys of his life.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On that day, after dinner, just as he was about to leave the table,\r\n'b'Pencroft felt a hand on his shoulder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the hand of Gideon Spilett, who said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne moment, Master Pencroft, you mustn\xe2\x80\x99t sneak off like that! You\xe2\x80\x99ve\r\n'b'forgotten your dessert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI am going back to my\r\n'b'work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, a cup of coffee, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA pipe, then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft jumped up, and his great good-natured face grew pale when he\r\n'b'saw the reporter presenting him with a ready-filled pipe, and Herbert\r\n'b'with a glowing coal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor endeavored to speak, but could not get out a word; so,\r\n'b'seizing the pipe, he carried it to his lips, then applying the coal,\r\n'b'he drew five or six great whiffs. A fragrant blue cloud soon arose, and\r\n'b'from its depths a voice was heard repeating excitedly,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTobacco! real tobacco!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand very good tobacco too!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cO, divine Providence; sacred Author of all things!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing more is now wanting to our island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Pencroft smoked, and smoked, and smoked.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who made this discovery?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked at length. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Herbert, no\r\n'b'doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft, it was Mr. Spilett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Spilett!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor, seizing the reporter, and clasping\r\n'b'him to his breast with such a squeeze that he had never felt anything\r\n'b'like it before.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, recovering his breath at last, \xe2\x80\x9ca truce for\r\n'b'one moment. You must share your gratitude with Herbert, who recognized\r\n'b'the plant, with Cyrus, who prepared it, and with Neb, who took a great\r\n'b'deal of trouble to keep our secret.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friends, I will repay you some day,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cNow\r\n'b'we are friends for life.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 11\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Winter arrived with the month of June, which is the December of the\r\n'b'northern zones, and the great business was the making of warm and solid\r\n'b'clothing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The musmons in the corral had been stripped of their wool, and this\r\n'b'precious textile material was now to be transformed into stuff.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Of course Cyrus Harding, having at his disposal neither carders,\r\n'b'combers, polishers, stretchers, twisters, mule-jenny, nor self-acting\r\n'b'machine to spin the wool, nor loom to weave it, was obliged to proceed\r\n'b'in a simpler way, so as to do without spinning and weaving. And indeed\r\n'b'he proposed to make use of the property which the filaments of wool\r\n'b'possess when subjected to a powerful pressure of mixing together, and of\r\n'b'manufacturing by this simple process the material called felt. This felt\r\n'b'could then be obtained by a simple operation which, if it diminished\r\n'b'the flexibility of the stuff, increased its power of retaining heat in\r\n'b'proportion. Now the wool furnished by the musmons was composed of very\r\n'b'short hairs, and was in a good condition to be felted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer, aided by his companions, including Pencroft, who was once\r\n'b'more obliged to leave his boat, commenced the preliminary operations,\r\n'b'the subject of which was to rid the wool of that fat and oily substance\r\n'b'with which it is impregnated, and which is called grease. This cleaning\r\n'b'was done in vats filled with water, which was maintained at the\r\n'b'temperature of seventy degrees, and in which the wool was soaked for\r\n'b'four-and-twenty hours; it was then thoroughly washed in baths of soda,\r\n'b'and, when sufficiently dried by pressure, it was in a state to be\r\n'b'compressed, that is to say, to produce a solid material, rough, no\r\n'b'doubt, and such as would have no value in a manufacturing center of\r\n'b'Europe or America, but which would be highly esteemed in the Lincoln\r\n'b'Island markets.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This sort of material must have been known from the most ancient times,\r\n'b'and, in fact, the first woolen stuffs were manufactured by the process\r\n'b'which Harding was now about to employ. Where Harding\xe2\x80\x99s engineering\r\n'b'qualifications now came into play was in the construction of the machine\r\n'b'for pressing the wool; for he knew how to turn ingeniously to profit\r\n'b'the mechanical force, hitherto unused, which the waterfall on the beach\r\n'b'possessed to move a fulling-mill.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nothing could be more rudimentary. The wool was placed in troughs, and\r\n'b'upon it fell in turns heavy wooden mallets; such was the machine in\r\n'b'question, and such it had been for centuries until the time when the\r\n'b'mallets were replaced by cylinders of compression, and the material was\r\n'b'no longer subjected to beating, but to regular rolling.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The operation, ably directed by Cyrus Harding, was a complete success.\r\n'b'The wool, previously impregnated with a solution of soap, intended on\r\n'b'the one hand to facilitate the interlacing, the compression, and the\r\n'b'softening of the wool, and on the other to prevent its diminution by\r\n'b'the beating, issued from the mill in the shape of thick felt cloth. The\r\n'b'roughnesses with which the staple of wool is naturally filled were so\r\n'b'thoroughly entangled and interlaced together that a material was formed\r\n'b'equally suitable either for garments or bedclothes. It was certainly\r\n'b'neither merino, muslin, cashmere, rep, satin, alpaca, cloth, nor\r\n'b'flannel. It was \xe2\x80\x9cLincolnian felt,\xe2\x80\x9d and Lincoln Island possessed yet\r\n'b'another manufacture. The colonists had now warm garments and thick\r\n'b'bedclothes, and they could without fear await the approach of the winter\r\n'b'of 1866-67.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The severe cold began to be felt about the 20th of June, and, to his\r\n'b'great regret, Pencroft was obliged to suspend his boat-building, which\r\n'b'he hoped to finish in time for next spring.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor\xe2\x80\x99s great idea was to make a voyage of discovery to Tabor\r\n'b'Island, although Harding could not approve of a voyage simply for\r\n'b'curiosity\xe2\x80\x99s sake, for there was evidently nothing to be found on this\r\n'b'desert and almost arid rock. A voyage of a hundred and fifty miles in a\r\n'b'comparatively small vessel, over unknown seas, could not but cause him\r\n'b'some anxiety. Suppose that their vessel, once out at sea, should be\r\n'b'unable to reach Tabor Island, and could not return to Lincoln Island,\r\n'b'what would become of her in the midst of the Pacific, so fruitful of\r\n'b'disasters?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding often talked over this project with Pencroft, and he found him\r\n'b'strangely bent upon undertaking this voyage, for which determination he\r\n'b'himself could give no sufficient reason.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer one day to him, \xe2\x80\x9cI must observe, my friend,\r\n'b'that after having said so much, in praise of Lincoln Island, after\r\n'b'having spoken so often of the sorrow you would feel if you were obliged\r\n'b'to forsake it, you are the first to wish to leave it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOnly to leave it for a few days,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9conly for a few\r\n'b'days, captain. Time to go and come back, and see what that islet is\r\n'b'like!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut it is not nearly as good as Lincoln Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know that beforehand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen why venture there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo know what is going on in Tabor Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut nothing is going on there; nothing could happen there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if you are caught in a hurricane?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no fear of that in the fine season,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, captain, as we must provide against everything, I shall ask your\r\n'b'permission to take Herbert only with me on this voyage.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, placing his hand on the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'shoulder, \xe2\x80\x9cif any misfortune happens to you, or to this lad, whom\r\n'b'chance has made our child, do you think we could ever cease to blame\r\n'b'ourselves?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, with unshaken confidence, \xe2\x80\x9cwe\r\n'b'shall not cause you that sorrow. Besides, we will speak further of this\r\n'b'voyage, when the time comes to make it. And I fancy, when you have seen\r\n'b'our tight-rigged little craft, when you have observed how she behaves at\r\n'b'sea, when we sail round our island, for we will do so together--I fancy,\r\n'b'I say, that you will no longer hesitate to let me go. I don\xe2\x80\x99t conceal\r\n'b'from you that your boat will be a masterpiece.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSay \xe2\x80\x98our\xe2\x80\x99 boat, at least, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, disarmed for\r\n'b'the moment. The conversation ended thus, to be resumed later on, without\r\n'b'convincing either the sailor or the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first snow fell towards the end of the month of June. The corral had\r\n'b'previously been largely supplied with stores, so that daily visits to\r\n'b'it were not requisite; but it was decided that more than a week should\r\n'b'never be allowed to pass without someone going to it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Traps were again set, and the machines manufactured by Harding were\r\n'b'tried. The bent whalebones, imprisoned in a case of ice, and covered\r\n'b'with a thick outer layer of fat, were placed on the border of the forest\r\n'b'at a spot where animals usually passed on their way to the lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s great satisfaction, this invention, copied from the\r\n'b'Aleutian fishermen, succeeded perfectly. A dozen foxes, a few wild\r\n'b'boars, and even a jaguar, were taken in this way, the animals being\r\n'b'found dead, their stomachs pierced by the unbent bones.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An incident must here be related, not only as interesting in itself, but\r\n'b'because it was the first attempt made by the colonists to communicate\r\n'b'with the rest of mankind.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett had already several times pondered whether to throw into\r\n'b'the sea a letter enclosed in a bottle, which currents might perhaps\r\n'b'carry to an inhabited coast, or to confide it to pigeons.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But how could it be seriously hoped that either pigeons or bottles could\r\n'b'cross the distance of twelve hundred miles which separated the island\r\n'b'from any inhabited land? It would have been pure folly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But on the 30th of June the capture was effected, not without\r\n'b'difficulty, of an albatross, which a shot from Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s gun had\r\n'b'slightly wounded in the foot. It was a magnificent bird, measuring ten\r\n'b'feet from wing to wing, and which could traverse seas as wide as the\r\n'b'Pacific.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert would have liked to keep this superb bird, as its wound would\r\n'b'soon heal, and he thought he could tame it; but Spilett explained to\r\n'b'him that they should not neglect this opportunity of attempting to\r\n'b'communicate by this messenger with the lands of the Pacific; for if the\r\n'b'albatross had come from some inhabited region, there was no doubt but\r\n'b'that it would return there so soon as it was set free.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Perhaps in his heart Gideon Spilett, in whom the journalist sometimes\r\n'b'came to the surface, was not sorry to have the opportunity of sending\r\n'b'forth to take its chance an exciting article relating the adventures\r\n'b'of the settlers in Lincoln Island. What a success for the authorized\r\n'b'reporter of the New York Herald, and for the number which should contain\r\n'b'the article, if it should ever reach the address of its editor, the\r\n'b'Honorable James Bennett!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett then wrote out a concise account, which was placed in a\r\n'b'strong waterproof bag, with an earnest request to whoever might find it\r\n'b'to forward it to the office of the New York Herald. This little bag was\r\n'b'fastened to the neck of the albatross, and not to its foot, for these\r\n'b'birds are in the habit of resting on the surface of the sea; then\r\n'b'liberty was given to this swift courier of the air, and it was not\r\n'b'without some emotion that the colonists watched it disappear in the\r\n'b'misty west.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he going to?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTowards New Zealand,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA good voyage to you,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the sailor, who himself did not expect\r\n'b'any great result from this mode of correspondence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'With the winter, work had been resumed in the interior of Granite House,\r\n'b'mending clothes and different occupations, among others making the sails\r\n'b'for their vessel, which were cut from the inexhaustible balloon-case.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the month of July the cold was intense, but there was no lack of\r\n'b'either wood or coal. Cyrus Harding had established a second fireplace in\r\n'b'the dining-room, and there the long winter evenings were spent. Talking\r\n'b'while they worked, reading when the hands remained idle, the time passed\r\n'b'with profit to all.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was real enjoyment to the settlers when in their room, well lighted\r\n'b'with candles, well warmed with coal, after a good dinner, elderberry\r\n'b'coffee smoking in the cups, the pipes giving forth an odoriferous smoke,\r\n'b'they could hear the storm howling without. Their comfort would have been\r\n'b'complete, if complete comfort could ever exist for those who are far\r\n'b'from their fellow-creatures, and without any means of communication with\r\n'b'them. They often talked of their country, of the friends whom they had\r\n'b'left, of the grandeur of the American Republic, whose influence could\r\n'b'not but increase; and Cyrus Harding, who had been much mixed up with the\r\n'b'affairs of the Union, greatly interested his auditors by his recitals,\r\n'b'his views, and his prognostics.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It chanced one day that Spilett was led to say--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut now, my dear Cyrus, all this industrial and commercial movement\r\n'b'to which you predict a continual advance, does it not run the danger of\r\n'b'being sooner or later completely stopped?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStopped! And by what?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy the want of coal, which may justly be called the most precious of\r\n'b'minerals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the most precious indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cand it would\r\n'b'seem that nature wished to prove that it was so by making the diamond,\r\n'b'which is simply pure carbon crystallized.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou don\xe2\x80\x99t mean to say, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we burn\r\n'b'diamonds in our stoves in the shape of coal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cyou do not deny that some day the\r\n'b'coal will be entirely consumed?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the veins of coal are still considerable, and the hundred\r\n'b'thousand miners who annually extract from them a hundred millions of\r\n'b'hundredweights have not nearly exhausted them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWith the increasing consumption of coal,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cit\r\n'b'can be foreseen that the hundred thousand workmen will soon become two\r\n'b'hundred thousand, and that the rate of extraction will be doubled.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless; but after the European mines, which will be soon worked more\r\n'b'thoroughly with new machines, the American and Australian mines will for\r\n'b'a long time yet provide for the consumption in trade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor how long a time?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor at least two hundred and fifty or three hundred years.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is reassuring for us, but a bad look-out for our\r\n'b'great-grandchildren!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey will discover something else,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is to be hoped so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cfor without coal there would\r\n'b'be no machinery, and without machinery there would be no railways, no\r\n'b'steamers, no manufactories, nothing of that which is indispensable to\r\n'b'modern civilization!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what will they find?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cCan you guess, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNearly, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what will they burn instead of coal?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWater,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWater!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwater as fuel for steamers and engines! water\r\n'b'to heat water!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, but water decomposed into its primitive elements,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand decomposed doubtless, by electricity, which will then have\r\n'b'become a powerful and manageable force, for all great discoveries, by\r\n'b'some inexplicable laws, appear to agree and become complete at the same\r\n'b'time. Yes, my friends, I believe that water will one day be employed\r\n'b'as fuel, that hydrogen and oxygen which constitute it, used singly or\r\n'b'together, will furnish an inexhaustible source of heat and light, of\r\n'b'an intensity of which coal is not capable. Some day the coalrooms of\r\n'b'steamers and the tenders of locomotives will, instead of coal, be stored\r\n'b'with these two condensed gases, which will burn in the furnaces with\r\n'b'enormous calorific power. There is, therefore, nothing to fear. As long\r\n'b'as the earth is inhabited it will supply the wants of its inhabitants,\r\n'b'and there will be no want of either light or heat as long as the\r\n'b'productions of the vegetable, mineral or animal kingdoms do not fail us.\r\n'b'I believe, then, that when the deposits of coal are exhausted we shall\r\n'b'heat and warm ourselves with water. Water will be the coal of the\r\n'b'future.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI should like to see that,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou were born too soon, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Neb, who only took part in\r\n'b'the discussion by these words.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, it was not Neb\xe2\x80\x99s speech which interrupted the conversation, but\r\n'b'Top\xe2\x80\x99s barking, which broke out again with that strange intonation which\r\n'b'had before perplexed the engineer. At the same time Top began to run\r\n'b'round the mouth of the well, which opened at the extremity of the\r\n'b'interior passage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat can Top be barking in that way for?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Jup be growling like that?\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact the orang, joining the dog, gave unequivocal signs of agitation,\r\n'b'and, singular to say, the two animals appeared more uneasy than angry.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is evident,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this well is in direct\r\n'b'communication with the sea, and that some marine animal comes from time\r\n'b'to time to breathe at the bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s evident,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand there can be no other\r\n'b'explanation to give. Quiet there, Top!\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft, turning to the\r\n'b'dog, \xe2\x80\x9cand you, Jup, be off to your room!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The ape and the dog were silent. Jup went off to bed, but Top remained\r\n'b'in the room, and continued to utter low growls at intervals during the\r\n'b'rest of the evening. There was no further talk on the subject, but the\r\n'b'incident, however, clouded the brow of the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the remainder of the month of July there was alternate rain and\r\n'b'frost. The temperature was not so low as during the preceding winter,\r\n'b'and its maximum did not exceed eight degrees Fahrenheit. But although\r\n'b'this winter was less cold, it was more troubled by storms and squalls;\r\n'b'the sea besides often endangered the safety of the Chimneys. At times\r\n'b'it almost seemed as if an under-current raised these monstrous billows\r\n'b'which thundered against the wall of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When the settlers, leaning from their windows, gazed on the huge watery\r\n'b'masses breaking beneath their eyes, they could not but admire the\r\n'b'magnificent spectacle of the ocean in its impotent fury. The waves\r\n'b'rebounded in dazzling foam, the beach entirely disapppearing under the\r\n'b'raging flood, and the cliff appearing to emerge from the sea itself, the\r\n'b'spray rising to a height of more than a hundred feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During these storms it was difficult and even dangerous to venture out,\r\n'b'owing to the frequently falling trees; however, the colonists never\r\n'b'allowed a week to pass without having paid a visit to the corral.\r\n'b'Happily, this enclosure, sheltered by the southeastern spur of Mount\r\n'b'Franklin, did not greatly suffer from the violence of the hurricanes,\r\n'b'which spared its trees, sheds, and palisades; but the poultry-yard on\r\n'b'Prospect Heights, being directly exposed to the gusts of wind from the\r\n'b'east, suffered considerable damage. The pigeon-house was twice unroofed\r\n'b'and the paling blown down. All this required to be remade more solidly\r\n'b'than before, for, as may be clearly seen, Lincoln Island was situated in\r\n'b'one of the most dangerous parts of the Pacific. It really appeared as if\r\n'b'it formed the central point of vast cyclones, which beat it perpetually\r\n'b'as the whip does the top, only here it was the top which was motionless\r\n'b'and the whip which moved. During the first week of the month of August\r\n'b'the weather became more moderate, and the atmosphere recovered the calm\r\n'b'which it appeared to have lost forever. With the calm the cold again\r\n'b'became intense, and the thermometer fell to eight degrees Fahrenheit,\r\n'b'below zero.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 3rd of August an excursion which had been talked of for several\r\n'b'days was made into the southeastern part of the island, towards Tadorn\r\n'b'Marsh. The hunters were tempted by the aquatic game which took up their\r\n'b'winter quarters there. Wild duck, snipe, teal and grebe abounded there,\r\n'b'and it was agreed that a day should be devoted to an expedition against\r\n'b'these birds.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Not only Gideon Spilett and Herbert, but Pencroft and Neb also took part\r\n'b'in this excursion. Cyrus Harding alone, alleging some work as an excuse,\r\n'b'did not join them, but remained at Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The hunters proceeded in the direction of Port Balloon, in order to\r\n'b'reach the marsh, after having promised to be back by the evening. Top\r\n'b'and Jup accompanied them. As soon as they had passed over the Mercy\r\n'b'Bridge, the engineer raised it and returned, intending to put into\r\n'b'execution a project for the performance of which he wished to be alone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now this project was to minutely explore the interior well, the mouth\r\n'b'of which was on a level with the passage of Granite House, and which\r\n'b'communicated with the sea, since it formerly supplied a way to the\r\n'b'waters of the lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Why did Top so often run round this opening? Why did he utter such\r\n'b'strange barks when a sort of uneasiness seemed to draw him towards this\r\n'b'well? Why did Jup join Top in a sort of common anxiety? Had this well\r\n'b'branches besides the communication with the sea? Did it spread towards\r\n'b'other parts of the island? This is what Cyrus Harding wished to know. He\r\n'b'had resolved, therefore, to attempt the exploration of the well during\r\n'b'the absence of his companions, and an opportunity for doing so had now\r\n'b'presented itself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was easy to descend to the bottom of the well by employing the rope\r\n'b'ladder which had not been used since the establishment of the lift. The\r\n'b'engineer drew the ladder to the hole, the diameter of which measured\r\n'b'nearly six feet, and allowed it to unroll itself after having securely\r\n'b'fastened its upper extremity. Then, having lighted a lantern, taken a\r\n'b'revolver, and placed a cutlass in his belt, he began the descent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sides were everywhere entire; but points of rock jutted out here and\r\n'b'there, and by means of these points it would have been quite possible\r\n'b'for an active creature to climb to the mouth of the well.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer remarked this; but although he carefully examined these\r\n'b'points by the light of his lantern, he could find no impression, no\r\n'b'fracture which could give any reason to suppose that they had either\r\n'b'recently or at any former time been used as a staircase. Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'descended deeper, throwing the light of his lantern on all sides.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He saw nothing suspicious.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When the engineer had reached the last rounds he came upon the water,\r\n'b'which was then perfectly calm. Neither at its level nor in any other\r\n'b'part of the well, did any passage open, which could lead to the interior\r\n'b'of the cliff. The wall which Harding struck with the hilt of his cutlass\r\n'b'sounded solid. It was compact granite, through which no living being\r\n'b'could force a way. To arrive at the bottom of the well and then climb\r\n'b'up to its mouth it was necessary to pass through the channel under the\r\n'b'rocky subsoil of the beach, which placed it in communication with the\r\n'b'sea, and this was only possible for marine animals. As to the question\r\n'b'of knowing where this channel ended, at what point of the shore, and at\r\n'b'what depth beneath the water, it could not be answered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then Cyrus Harding, having ended his survey, re-ascended, drew up the\r\n'b'ladder, covered the mouth of the well, and returned thoughtfully to the\r\n'b'diningroom, saying to himself,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have seen nothing, and yet there is something there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 12\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the evening the hunters returned, having enjoyed good sport, and\r\n'b'being literally loaded with game; indeed, they had as much as four men\r\n'b'could possibly carry. Top wore a necklace of teal and Jup wreaths of\r\n'b'snipe round his body.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere, master,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb; \xe2\x80\x9chere\xe2\x80\x99s something to employ our time!\r\n'b'Preserved and made into pies we shall have a welcome store! But I must\r\n'b'have some one to help me. I count on you, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cI have the rigging of the vessel to\r\n'b'finish and to look after, and you will have to do without me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Mr. Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI must go to the corral to-morrow, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lad.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be you then, Mr. Spilett, who will help me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo oblige you, Neb, I will,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter; \xe2\x80\x9cbut I warn you that\r\n'b'if you disclose your recipes to me, I shall publish them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhenever you like, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb; \xe2\x80\x9cwhenever you like.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And so the next day Gideon Spilett became Neb\xe2\x80\x99s assistant and was\r\n'b'installed in his culinary laboratory. The engineer had previously made\r\n'b'known to him the result of the exploration which he had made the day\r\n'b'before, and on this point the reporter shared Harding\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, that\r\n'b'although he had found nothing, a secret still remained to be discovered!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The frost continued for another week, and the settlers did not leave\r\n'b'Granite House unless to look after the poultry-yard. The dwelling\r\n'b'was filled with appetizing odors, which were emitted from the learned\r\n'b'manipulation of Neb and the reporter. But all the results of the chase\r\n'b'were not made into preserved provisions; and as the game kept perfectly\r\n'b'in the intense cold, wild duck and other fowl were eaten fresh, and\r\n'b'declared superior to all other aquatic birds in the known world.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this week, Pencroft, aided by Herbert, who handled the\r\n'b'sailmaker\xe2\x80\x99s needle with much skill, worked with such energy that the\r\n'b'sails of the vessel were finished. There was no want of cordage. Thanks\r\n'b'to the rigging which had been discovered with the case of the balloon,\r\n'b'the ropes and cables from the net were all of good quality, and the\r\n'b'sailor turned them all to account. To the sails were attached strong\r\n'b'bolt ropes, and there still remained enough from which to make the\r\n'b'halyards, shrouds, and sheets, etc. The blocks were manufactured by\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding under Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s directions by means of the turning lathe.\r\n'b'It therefore happened that the rigging was entirely prepared before the\r\n'b'vessel was finished. Pencroft also manufactured a flag, that flag so\r\n'b'dear to every true American, containing the stars and stripes of their\r\n'b'glorious Union. The colors for it were supplied from certain plants\r\n'b'used in dyeing, and which were very abundant in the island; only to the\r\n'b'thirty-seven stars, representing the thirty-seven States of the Union,\r\n'b'which shine on the American flag, the sailor added a thirty-eighth, the\r\n'b'star of \xe2\x80\x9cthe State of Lincoln,\xe2\x80\x9d for he considered his island as already\r\n'b'united to the great republic. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cit is so already in\r\n'b'heart, if not in deed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meantime, the flag was hoisted at the central window of Granite\r\n'b'House, and the settlers saluted it with three cheers.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cold season was now almost at an end, and it appeared as if this\r\n'b'second winter was to pass without any unusual occurrence, when on the\r\n'b'night of the 11th of August, the plateau of Prospect Heights was menaced\r\n'b'with complete destruction.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After a busy day the colonists were sleeping soundly, when towards four\r\n'b'o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning they were suddenly awakened by Top\xe2\x80\x99s barking.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The dog was not this time barking near the mouth of the well, but at\r\n'b'the threshold of the door, at which he was scratching as if he wished to\r\n'b'burst it open. Jup was also uttering piercing cries.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHello, Top!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb, who was the first awake. But the dog continued\r\n'b'to bark more furiously than ever.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And all dressing in haste rushed to the windows, which they opened.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Beneath their eyes was spread a sheet of snow which looked gray in the\r\n'b'dim light. The settlers could see nothing, but they heard a singular\r\n'b'yelping noise away in the darkness. It was evident that the beach had\r\n'b'been invaded by a number of animals which could not be seen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are they?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWolves, jaguars, or apes?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey have nearly reached the plateau,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our poultry-yard,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand our garden!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere can they have crossed?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey must have crossed the bridge on the shore,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cwhich one of us must have forgotten to close.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cI remember having left it open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA fine job you have made of it, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is done cannot be undone,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must consult\r\n'b'what it will now be best to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Such were the questions and answers which were rapidly exchanged between\r\n'b'Harding and his companions. It was certain that the bridge had been\r\n'b'crossed, that the shore had been invaded by animals, and that whatever\r\n'b'they might be they could by ascending the left bank of the Mercy reach\r\n'b'Prospect Heights. They must therefore be advanced against quickly and\r\n'b'fought with if necessary.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what are these beasts?\xe2\x80\x9d was asked a second time, as the yelpings\r\n'b'were again heard more loudly than before. These yelps made Herbert\r\n'b'start, and he remembered having heard them before during his first visit\r\n'b'to the sources of the Red Creek.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are colpeo foxes!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And all arming themselves with hatchets, carbines, and revolvers, threw\r\n'b'themselves into the lift and soon set foot on the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Colpeos are dangerous animals when in great numbers and irritated by\r\n'b'hunger, nevertheless the colonists did not hesitate to throw themselves\r\n'b'into the midst of the troop, and their first shots vividly lighting up\r\n'b'the darkness made their assailants draw back.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The chief thing was to hinder these plunderers from reaching the\r\n'b'plateau, for the garden and the poultry-yard would then have been at\r\n'b'their mercy, and immense, perhaps irreparable mischief, would inevitably\r\n'b'be the result, especially with regard to the corn-field. But as the\r\n'b'invasion of the plateau could only be made by the left bank of the\r\n'b'Mercy, it was sufficient to oppose the colpeos on the narrow bank\r\n'b'between the river and the cliff of granite.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was plain to all, and, by Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s orders, they reached the\r\n'b'spot indicated by him, while the colpeos rushed fiercely through\r\n'b'the gloom. Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft and Neb posted\r\n'b'themselves in impregnable line. Top, his formidable jaws open, preceded\r\n'b'the colonists, and he was followed by Jup, armed with a knotty cudgel,\r\n'b'which he brandished like a club.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night was extremely dark, it was only by the flashes from the\r\n'b'revolvers as each person fired that they could see their assailants, who\r\n'b'were at least a hundred in number, and whose eyes were glowing like hot\r\n'b'coals.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey must not pass!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey shall not pass!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But if they did not pass it was not for want of having attempted it.\r\n'b'Those in the rear pushed on the foremost assailants, and it was an\r\n'b'incessant struggle with revolvers and hatchets. Several colpeos already\r\n'b'lay dead on the ground, but their number did not appear to diminish,\r\n'b'and it might have been supposed that reinforcements were continually\r\n'b'arriving over the bridge.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists were soon obliged to fight at close quarters, not without\r\n'b'receiving some wounds, though happily very slight ones. Herbert had,\r\n'b'with a shot from his revolver, rescued Neb, on whose back a colpeo had\r\n'b'sprung like a tiger cat. Top fought with actual fury, flying at the\r\n'b'throats of the foxes and strangling them instantaneously. Jup wielded\r\n'b'his weapon valiantly, and it was in vain that they endeavored to keep\r\n'b'him in the rear. Endowed doubtless with sight which enabled him to\r\n'b'pierce the obscurity, he was always in the thick of the fight uttering\r\n'b'from time to time--a sharp hissing sound, which was with him the sign of\r\n'b'great rejoicing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At one moment he advanced so far, that by the light from a revolver\r\n'b'he was seen surrounded by five or six large colpeos, with whom he was\r\n'b'coping with great coolness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the struggle was ended at last, and victory was on the side\r\n'b'of the settlers, but not until they had fought for two long hours! The\r\n'b'first signs of the approach of day doubtless determined the retreat of\r\n'b'their assailants, who scampered away towards the North, passing over the\r\n'b'bridge, which Neb ran immediately to raise. When day had sufficiently\r\n'b'lighted up the field of battle, the settlers counted as many as fifty\r\n'b'dead bodies scattered about on the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Jup!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cwhere is Jup?\xe2\x80\x9d Jup had disappeared. His\r\n'b'friend Neb called him, and for the first time Jup did not reply to his\r\n'b'friend\xe2\x80\x99s call.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Everyone set out in search of Jup, trembling lest he should be found\r\n'b'among the slain; they cleared the place of the bodies which stained the\r\n'b'snow with their blood. Jup was found in the midst of a heap of colpeos\r\n'b'whose broken jaws and crushed bodies showed that they had to do with the\r\n'b'terrible club of the intrepid animal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Poor Jup still held in his hand the stump of his broken cudgel, but\r\n'b'deprived of his weapon he had been overpowered by numbers, and his chest\r\n'b'was covered with severe wounds.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe is living,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb, who was bending over him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we will save him,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will nurse him as if he\r\n'b'was one of ourselves.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It appeared as if Jup understood, for he leaned his head on Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'shoulder as if to thank him. The sailor was wounded himself, but his\r\n'b'wound was insignificant, as were those of his companions; for thanks to\r\n'b'their firearms they had been almost always able to keep their assailants\r\n'b'at a distance. It was therefore only the orang whose condition was\r\n'b'serious.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Jup, carried by Neb and Pencroft, was placed in the lift, and only a\r\n'b'slight moan now and then escaped his lips. He was gently drawn up to\r\n'b'Granite House. There he was laid on a mattress taken from one of the\r\n'b'beds, and his wounds were bathed with the greatest care. It did not\r\n'b'appear that any vital part had been reached, but Jup was very weak from\r\n'b'loss of blood, and a high fever soon set in after his wounds had been\r\n'b'dressed. He was laid down, strict diet was imposed, \xe2\x80\x9cjust like a real\r\n'b'person,\xe2\x80\x9d as Neb said, and they made him swallow several cups of\r\n'b'a cooling drink, for which the ingredients were supplied from the\r\n'b'vegetable medicine chest of Granite House. Jup was at first restless,\r\n'b'but his breathing gradually became more regular, and he was left\r\n'b'sleeping quietly. From time to time Top, walking on tip-toe, as one\r\n'b'might say, came to visit his friend, and seemed to approve of all the\r\n'b'care that had been taken of him. One of Jup\xe2\x80\x99s hands hung over the side\r\n'b'of his bed, and Top licked it with a sympathizing air.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They employed the day in interring the dead, who were dragged to the\r\n'b'forest of the Far West, and there buried deep.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This attack, which might have had such serious consequences, was a\r\n'b'lesson to the settlers, who from this time never went to bed until one\r\n'b'of their number had made sure that all the bridges were raised, and that\r\n'b'no invasion was possible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, Jup, after having given them serious anxiety for several\r\n'b'days, began to recover. His constitution brought him through, the fever\r\n'b'gradually subsided, and Gideon Spilett, who was a bit of a doctor,\r\n'b'pronounced him quite out of danger. On the 16th of August, Jup began to\r\n'b'eat. Neb made him nice little sweet dishes, which the invalid devoured\r\n'b'with great relish, for if he had a pet failing it was that of being\r\n'b'somewhat of a gourmand, and Neb had never done anything to cure him of\r\n'b'this fault.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would you have?\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Gideon Spilett, who sometimes\r\n'b'expostulated with him for spoiling the ape. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Jup has no other\r\n'b'pleasure than that of the palate, and I am only too glad to be able to\r\n'b'reward his services in this way!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ten days after taking to his bed, on the 21st of August, Master Jup\r\n'b'arose. His wounds were healed, and it was evident that he would not\r\n'b'be long in regaining his usual strength and agility. Like all\r\n'b'convalescents, he was tremendously hungry, and the reporter allowed him\r\n'b'to eat as much as he liked, for he trusted to that instinct, which\r\n'b'is too often wanting in reasoning beings, to keep the orang from any\r\n'b'excess. Neb was delighted to see his pupil\xe2\x80\x99s appetite returning.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEat away, my Jup,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand don\xe2\x80\x99t spare anything; you have shed\r\n'b'your blood for us, and it is the least I can do to make you strong\r\n'b'again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 25th of August Neb\xe2\x80\x99s voice was heard calling to his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, Mr. Spilett, Mr. Herbert, Pencroft, come! come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists, who were together in the dining-room, rose at Neb\xe2\x80\x99s call,\r\n'b'who was then in Jup\xe2\x80\x99s room.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb, with a shout of laughter. And what did they see?\r\n'b'Master Jup smoking calmly and seriously, sitting crosslegged like a Turk\r\n'b'at the entrance to Granite House!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy pipe,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cHe has taken my pipe! Hello, my honest Jup,\r\n'b'I make you a present of it! Smoke away, old boy, smoke away!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Jup gravely puffed out clouds of smoke which seemed to give him\r\n'b'great satisfaction. Harding did not appear to be much astonished at this\r\n'b'incident, and he cited several examples of tame apes, to whom the use of\r\n'b'tobacco had become quite familiar.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But from this day Master Jup had a pipe of his own, the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'ex-pipe, which was hung in his room near his store of tobacco. He filled\r\n'b'it himself, lighted it with a glowing coal, and appeared to be\r\n'b'the happiest of quadrumana. It may readily be understood that this\r\n'b'similarity of tastes of Jup and Pencroft served to tighten the bonds of\r\n'b'friendship which already existed between the honest ape and the worthy\r\n'b'sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he is really a man,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft sometimes to Neb. \xe2\x80\x9cShould\r\n'b'you be surprised to hear him beginning to speak to us some day?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy word, no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat astonishes me is that he hasn\xe2\x80\x99t spoken\r\n'b'to us before, for now he wants nothing but speech!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt would amuse me all the same,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cif some fine day\r\n'b'he said to me, \xe2\x80\x98Suppose we change pipes, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat a pity he was born dumb!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'With the month of September the winter ended, and the works were again\r\n'b'eagerly commenced. The building of the vessel advanced rapidly, she was\r\n'b'already completely decked over, and all the inside parts of the hull\r\n'b'were firmly united with ribs bent by means of steam, which answered all\r\n'b'the purposes of a mold.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As there was no want of wood, Pencroft proposed to the engineer to give\r\n'b'a double lining to the hull, to insure the strength of the vessel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding, not knowing what the future might have in store for them,\r\n'b'approved the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s idea of making the craft as strong as possible.\r\n'b'The interior and deck of the vessel was entirely finished towards the\r\n'b'15th of September. For calking the seams they made oakum of dry seaweed,\r\n'b'which was hammered in between the planks; then these seams were covered\r\n'b'with boiling tar, which was obtained in great abundance from the pines\r\n'b'in the forest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The management of the vessel was very simple. She had from the first\r\n'b'been ballasted with heavy blocks of granite walled up, in a bed of lime,\r\n'b'twelve thousand pounds of which they stowed away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A deck was placed over this ballast, and the interior was divided into\r\n'b'two cabins; two benches extended along them and served also as lockers.\r\n'b'The foot of the mast supported the partition which separated the two\r\n'b'cabins, which were reached by two hatchways let into the deck.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft had no trouble in finding a tree suitable for the mast. He\r\n'b'chose a straight young fir, with no knots, and which he had only to\r\n'b'square at the step, and round off at the top. The ironwork of the mast,\r\n'b'the rudder and the hull had been roughly but strongly forged at the\r\n'b'Chimneys. Lastly, yards, masts, boom, spars, oars, etc., were all\r\n'b'furnished by the first week in October, and it was agreed that a trial\r\n'b'trip should be taken round the island, so as to ascertain how the vessel\r\n'b'would behave at sea, and how far they might depend upon her.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During all this time the necessary works had not been neglected.\r\n'b'The corral was enlarged, for the flock of musmons and goats had been\r\n'b'increased by a number of young ones, who had to be housed and fed. The\r\n'b'colonists had paid visits also to the oyster bed, the warren, the coal\r\n'b'and iron mines, and to the till then unexplored districts of the Far\r\n'b'West forest, which abounded in game. Certain indigenous plants were\r\n'b'discovered, and those fit for immediate use contributed to vary the\r\n'b'vegetable stores of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were a species of ficoide, some similar to those of the Cape, with\r\n'b'eatable fleshy leaves, others bearing seeds containing a sort of flour.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 10th of October the vessel was launched. Pencroft was radiant\r\n'b'with joy, the operation was perfectly successful; the boat completely\r\n'b'rigged, having been pushed on rollers to the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, was floated\r\n'b'by the rising tide, amid the cheers of the colonists, particularly of\r\n'b'Pencroft, who showed no modesty on this occasion. Besides his importance\r\n'b'was to last beyond the finishing of the vessel, since, after having\r\n'b'built her, he was to command her. The grade of captain was bestowed upon\r\n'b'him with the approbation of all. To satisfy Captain Pencroft, it was now\r\n'b'necessary to give a name to the vessel, and, after many propositions had\r\n'b'been discussed, the votes were all in favor of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d As\r\n'b'soon as the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d had been lifted by the rising tide, it was\r\n'b'seen that she lay evenly in the water, and would be easily navigated.\r\n'b'However, the trial trip was to be made that very day, by an excursion\r\n'b'off the coast. The weather was fine, the breeze fresh, and the sea\r\n'b'smooth, especially towards the south coast, for the wind was blowing\r\n'b'from the northwest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll hands on board,\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pencroft; but breakfast was first\r\n'b'necessary, and it was thought best to take provisions on board, in the\r\n'b'event of their excursion being prolonged until the evening.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding was equally anxious to try the vessel, the model of which\r\n'b'had originated with him, although on the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s advice he had altered\r\n'b'some parts of it, but he did not share Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in her,\r\n'b'and as the latter had not again spoken of the voyage to Tabor Island,\r\n'b'Harding hoped he had given it up. He would have indeed great reluctance\r\n'b'in letting two or three of his companions venture so far in so small a\r\n'b'boat, which was not of more than fifteen tons\xe2\x80\x99 burden.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At half-past ten everybody was on board, even Top and Jup, and Herbert\r\n'b'weighed the anchor, which was fast in the sand near the mouth of the\r\n'b'Mercy. The sail was hoisted, the Lincolnian flag floated from the\r\n'b'masthead, and the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d steered by Pencroft, stood out to sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The wind blowing out of Union Bay she ran before it, and thus showed her\r\n'b'owners, much to their satisfaction, that she possessed a remarkably fast\r\n'b'pair of heels, according to Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s mode of speaking. After having\r\n'b'doubled Flotsam Point and Claw Cape, the captain kept her close hauled,\r\n'b'so as to sail along the southern coast of the island, when it was found\r\n'b'she sailed admirably within five points of the wind. All hands were\r\n'b'enchanted, they had a good vessel, which, in case of need, would be\r\n'b'of great service to them, and with fine weather and a fresh breeze the\r\n'b'voyage promised to be charming.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft now stood off the shore, three or four miles across from Port\r\n'b'Balloon. The island then appeared in all its extent and under a new\r\n'b'aspect, with the varied panorama of its shore from Claw Cape to Reptile\r\n'b'End, the forests in which dark firs contrasted with the young foliage\r\n'b'of other trees and overlooked the whole, and Mount Franklin whose lofty\r\n'b'head was still whitened with snow.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow beautiful it is!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, our island is beautiful and good,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cI love it as\r\n'b'I loved my poor mother. It received us poor and destitute, and now what\r\n'b'is wanting to us five fellows who fell on it from the sky?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb; \xe2\x80\x9cnothing, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the two brave men gave three tremendous cheers in honor of their\r\n'b'island!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During all this time Gideon Spilett, leaning against the mast, sketched\r\n'b'the panorama which was developed before his eyes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding gazed on it in silence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you think of our\r\n'b'vessel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe appears to behave well,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood! And do you think now that she could undertake a voyage of some\r\n'b'extent?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat voyage, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne to Tabor Island, for instance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that in any pressing emergency\r\n'b'we need not hesitate to trust ourselves to the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 even for\r\n'b'a longer voyage; but you know I should see you set off to Tabor Island\r\n'b'with great uneasiness, since nothing obliges you to go there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne likes to know one\xe2\x80\x99s neighbors,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor, who was\r\n'b'obstinate in his idea. \xe2\x80\x9cTabor Island is our neighbor, and the only one!\r\n'b'Politeness requires us to go at least to pay a visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cour friend Pencroft has become very particular\r\n'b'about the proprieties all at once!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not particular about anything at all,\xe2\x80\x9d retorted the sailor, who\r\n'b'was rather vexed by the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s opposition, but who did not wish to\r\n'b'cause him anxiety.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cConsider, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cyou cannot go alone to Tabor\r\n'b'Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne companion will be enough for me.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEven so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will risk depriving the colony of\r\n'b'Lincoln Island of two settlers out of five.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOut of six,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget Jup.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOut of seven,\xe2\x80\x9d added Neb; \xe2\x80\x9cTop is quite worth another.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no risk at all in it, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is possible, Pencroft; but I repeat it is to expose ourselves\r\n'b'uselessly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The obstinate sailor did not reply, and let the conversation drop, quite\r\n'b'determined to resume it again. But he did not suspect that an incident\r\n'b'would come to his aid and change into an act of humanity that which was\r\n'b'at first only a doubtful whim.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After standing off the shore the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d again approached it\r\n'b'in the direction of Port Balloon. It was important to ascertain the\r\n'b'channels between the sandbanks and reefs, that buoys might be laid down\r\n'b'since this little creek was to be the harbor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were not more than half a mile from the coast, and it was necessary\r\n'b'to tack to beat against the wind. The \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was then going at a\r\n'b'very moderate rate, as the breeze, partly intercepted by the high land,\r\n'b'scarcely swelled her sails, and the sea, smooth as glass, was only\r\n'b'rippled now and then by passing gusts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert had stationed himself in the bows that he might indicate the\r\n'b'course to be followed among the channels, when all at once he shouted,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLuff, Pencroft, luff!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9ca rock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo--wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t quite see. Luff again--right--now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So saying, Herbert, leaning over the side, plunged his arm into the\r\n'b'water, and pulled it out, exclaiming,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA bottle!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He held in his hand a corked bottle which he had just seized a few\r\n'b'cables\xe2\x80\x99 length from the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding took the bottle. Without uttering a single word he drew\r\n'b'the cork, and took from it a damp paper, on which were written these\r\n'b'words:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCastaway.... Tabor island: 153deg W. long., 37deg 11\xe2\x80\x99 S. lat.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 13\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA castaway!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cleft on this Tabor Island not two\r\n'b'hundred miles from us! Ah, Captain Harding, you won\xe2\x80\x99t now oppose my\r\n'b'going.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cand you shall set out as soon as\r\n'b'possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer still held in his hand the paper which he had taken from\r\n'b'the bottle. He contemplated it for some instants, then resumed,\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrom this document, my friends, from the way in which it is worded,\r\n'b'we may conclude this: first, that the castaway on Tabor Island is a man\r\n'b'possessing a considerable knowledge of navigation, since he gives the\r\n'b'latitude and longitude of the island exactly as we ourselves found it,\r\n'b'and to a second of approximation; secondly, that he is either English or\r\n'b'American, as the document is written in the English language.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is perfectly logical,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Spilett; \xe2\x80\x9cand the presence of this\r\n'b'castaway explains the arrival of the case on the shores of our island.\r\n'b'There must have been a wreck, since there is a castaway. As to the\r\n'b'latter, whoever he may be, it is lucky for him that Pencroft thought of\r\n'b'building this boat and of trying her this very day, for a day later and\r\n'b'this bottle might have been broken on the rocks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cit is a fortunate chance that the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 passed exactly where the bottle was still floating!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDoes not this appear strange to you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding of Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt appears fortunate, that\xe2\x80\x99s all,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you see\r\n'b'anything extraordinary in it, captain? The bottle must go somewhere, and\r\n'b'why not here as well as anywhere else?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps you are right, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cand yet--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthere\xe2\x80\x99s nothing to prove that this bottle has\r\n'b'been floating long in the sea.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand the document appears even to\r\n'b'have been recently written. What do you think about it, Cyrus?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this conversation Pencroft had not remained inactive. He had put\r\n'b'the vessel about, and the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d all sails set, was running\r\n'b'rapidly towards Claw Cape.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Every one was thinking of the castaway on Tabor Island. Should they\r\n'b'be in time to save him? This was a great event in the life of the\r\n'b'colonists! They themselves were but castaways, but it was to be feared\r\n'b'that another might not have been so fortunate, and their duty was to go\r\n'b'to his succor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Claw Cape was doubled, and about four o\xe2\x80\x99clock the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d dropped\r\n'b'her anchor at the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That same evening the arrangements for the new expedition were made.\r\n'b'It appeared best that Pencroft and Herbert, who knew how to work the\r\n'b'vessel, should undertake the voyage alone. By setting out the next day,\r\n'b'the 10th of October, they would arrive on the 13th, for with the present\r\n'b'wind it would not take more than forty-eight hours to make this passage\r\n'b'of a hundred and fifty miles. One day in the island, three or four to\r\n'b'return, they might hope therefore that on the 17th they would again\r\n'b'reach Lincoln Island. The weather was fine, the barometer was rising,\r\n'b'the wind appeared settled, everything then was in favor of these brave\r\n'b'men whom an act of humanity was taking far from their island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus it had been agreed that Cyrus Harding, Neb, and Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'should remain at Granite House, but an objection was raised, and\r\n'b'Spilett, who had not forgotten his business as reporter to the New York\r\n'b'Herald, having declared that he would go by swimming rather than lose\r\n'b'such an opportunity, he was admitted to take a part in the voyage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The evening was occupied in transporting on board the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' articles of bedding, utensils, arms, ammunition, a compass, provisions\r\n'b'for a week; this being rapidly done, the colonists ascended to Granite\r\n'b'House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, at five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, the farewells were said,\r\n'b'not without some emotion on both sides, and Pencroft setting sail made\r\n'b'towards Claw Cape, which had to be doubled in order to proceed to the\r\n'b'southwest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was already a quarter of a mile from the coast when\r\n'b'the passengers perceived on the heights of Granite House two men waving\r\n'b'their farewells; they were Cyrus Harding and Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur friends,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is our first separation in\r\n'b'fifteen months.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, the reporter and Herbert waved in return, and Granite House\r\n'b'soon disappeared behind the high rocks of the Cape.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the first part of the day the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was still in sight\r\n'b'of the southern coast of Lincoln Island, which soon appeared just like\r\n'b'a green basket, with Mount Franklin rising from the center. The heights,\r\n'b'diminished by distance, did not present an appearance likely to tempt\r\n'b'vessels to touch there. Reptile End was passed in about an hour, though\r\n'b'at a distance of about ten miles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this distance it was no longer possible to distinguish anything of\r\n'b'the Western Coast, which stretched away to the ridges of Mount Franklin,\r\n'b'and three hours after the last of Lincoln Island sank below the horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d behaved capitally. Bounding over the waves she\r\n'b'proceeded rapidly on her course. Pencroft had hoisted the foresail, and\r\n'b'steering by the compass followed a rectilinear direction. From time to\r\n'b'time Herbert relieved him at the helm, and the lad\xe2\x80\x99s hand was so firm\r\n'b'that the sailor had not a point to find fault with.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett chatted sometimes with one, sometimes with the other, if\r\n'b'wanted he lent a hand with the ropes, and Captain Pencroft was perfectly\r\n'b'satisfied with his crew.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the evening the crescent moon, which would not be in its first\r\n'b'quarter until the 16th, appeared in the twilight and soon set again. The\r\n'b'night was dark but starry, and the next day again promised to be fine.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft prudently lowered the foresail, not wishing to be caught by\r\n'b'a sudden gust while carrying too much canvas; it was perhaps an\r\n'b'unnecessary precaution on such a calm night, but Pencroft was a prudent\r\n'b'sailor and cannot be blamed for it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter slept part of the night. Pencroft and Herbert took turns\r\n'b'for a spell of two hours each at the helm. The sailor trusted Herbert as\r\n'b'he would himself, and his confidence was justified by the coolness and\r\n'b'judgment of the lad. Pencroft gave him his directions as a commander to\r\n'b'his steersman, and Herbert never allowed the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d to swerve\r\n'b'even a point. The night passed quickly, as did the day of the 12th of\r\n'b'October. A south-easterly direction was strictly maintained. Unless the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d fell in with some unknown current she would come exactly\r\n'b'within sight of Tabor Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the sea over which the vessel was then sailing, it was absolutely\r\n'b'deserted. Now and then a great albatross or frigate bird passed within\r\n'b'gunshot, and Gideon Spilett wondered if it was to one of them that he\r\n'b'had confided his last letter addressed to the New York Herald. These\r\n'b'birds were the only beings that appeared to frequent this part of the\r\n'b'ocean between Tabor and Lincoln Islands.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is the time that whalers usually\r\n'b'proceed towards the southern part of the Pacific. Indeed I do not think\r\n'b'there could be a more deserted sea than this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not quite so deserted as all that,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are on it. Do you take our vessel for a wreck and us for porpoises?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Pencroft laughed at his joke.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'By the evening, according to calculation, it was thought that the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d had accomplished a distance of a hundred and twenty miles\r\n'b'since her departure from Lincoln Island, that is to say in thirty-six\r\n'b'hours, which would give her a speed of between three and four knots.\r\n'b'The breeze was very slight and might soon drop altogether.\r\n'b'However, it was hoped that the next morning by break of day, if the\r\n'b'calculation had been correct and the course true, they would sight Tabor\r\n'b'Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neither Gideon Spilett, Herbert, nor Pencroft slept that night. In the\r\n'b'expectation of the next day they could not but feel some emotion.\r\n'b'There was so much uncertainty in their enterprise! Were they near Tabor\r\n'b'Island? Was the island still inhabited by the castaway to whose succor\r\n'b'they had come? Who was this man? Would not his presence disturb the\r\n'b'little colony till then so united? Besides, would he be content to\r\n'b'exchange his prison for another? All these questions, which would no\r\n'b'doubt be answered the next day, kept them in suspense, and at the dawn\r\n'b'of day they all fixed their gaze on the western horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLand!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pencroft at about six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And it was impossible that Pencroft should be mistaken, it was\r\n'b'evident that land was there. Imagine the joy of the little crew of\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d In a few hours they would land on the beach of the\r\n'b'island!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The low coast of Tabor Island, scarcely emerging from the sea, was not\r\n'b'more than fifteen miles distant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The head of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d which was a little to the south of the\r\n'b'island, was set directly towards it, and as the sun mounted in the east,\r\n'b'its rays fell upon one or two headlands.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is a much less important isle than Lincoln Island,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\n'b'Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand is probably due like ours to some submarine convulsion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was not more than two miles off,\r\n'b'and Pencroft, while looking for a suitable place at which to land,\r\n'b'proceeded very cautiously through the unknown waters. The whole of the\r\n'b'island could now be surveyed, and on it could be seen groups of gum\r\n'b'and other large trees, of the same species as those growing on Lincoln\r\n'b'Island. But the astonishing thing was that no smoke arose to show that\r\n'b'the island was inhabited, no signal whatever appeared on the shore!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And yet the document was clear enough; there was a castaway, and this\r\n'b'castaway should have been on the watch.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d entered the winding channels among\r\n'b'the reefs, and Pencroft observed every turn with extreme care. He had\r\n'b'put Herbert at the helm, posting himself in the bows, inspecting the\r\n'b'water, while he held the halliard in his hand, ready to lower the sail\r\n'b'at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice. Gideon Spilett with his glass eagerly scanned the\r\n'b'shore, though without perceiving anything.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, at about twelve o\xe2\x80\x99clock the keel of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d grated\r\n'b'on the bottom. The anchor was let go, the sails furled, and the crew of\r\n'b'the little vessel landed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And there was no reason to doubt that this was Tabor Island, since\r\n'b'according to the most recent charts there was no island in this part of\r\n'b'the Pacific between New Zealand and the American Coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The vessel was securely moored, so that there should be no danger of\r\n'b'her being carried away by the receding tide; then Pencroft and his\r\n'b'companions, well armed, ascended the shore, so as to gain an elevation\r\n'b'of about two hundred and fifty or three hundred feet which rose at a\r\n'b'distance of half a mile.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFrom the summit of that hill,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can no doubt obtain a\r\n'b'complete view of the island, which will greatly facilitate our search.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo as to do here,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat which Captain Harding did the\r\n'b'very first thing on Lincoln Island, by climbing Mount Franklin.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is the best plan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While thus talking the explorers had advanced along a clearing\r\n'b'which terminated at the foot of the hill. Flocks of rock-pigeons and\r\n'b'sea-swallows, similar to those of Lincoln Island, fluttered around them.\r\n'b'Under the woods which skirted the glade on the left they could hear the\r\n'b'bushes rustling and see the grass waving, which indicated the presence\r\n'b'of timid animals, but still nothing to show that the island was\r\n'b'inhabited.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Arrived at the foot of the hill, Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert climbed\r\n'b'it in a few minutes, and gazed anxiously round the horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were on an islet, which did not measure more than six miles in\r\n'b'circumference, its shape not much bordered by capes or promontories,\r\n'b'bays or creeks, being a lengthened oval. All around, the lonely sea\r\n'b'extended to the limits of the horizon. No land nor even a sail was in\r\n'b'sight.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This woody islet did not offer the varied aspects of Lincoln Island,\r\n'b'arid and wild in one part, but fertile and rich in the other. On the\r\n'b'contrary this was a uniform mass of verdure, out of which rose two or\r\n'b'three hills of no great height. Obliquely to the oval of the island ran\r\n'b'a stream through a wide meadow falling into the sea on the west by a\r\n'b'narrow mouth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe domain is limited,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Pencroft: \xe2\x80\x9cIt would have been too small for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd moreover,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cit appears to be uninhabited.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cnothing here betrays the presence of man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go down,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand search.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor and his two companions returned to the shore, to the place\r\n'b'where they had left the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had decided to make the tour of the island on foot, before\r\n'b'exploring the interior; so that not a spot should escape their\r\n'b'investigations. The beach was easy to follow, and only in some places\r\n'b'was their way barred by large rocks, which, however, they easily passed\r\n'b'round. The explorers proceeded towards the south, disturbing numerous\r\n'b'flocks of sea-birds and herds of seals, which threw themselves into the\r\n'b'sea as soon as they saw the strangers at a distance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThose beasts yonder,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not see men for the\r\n'b'first time. They fear them, therefore they must know them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An hour after their departure they arrived on the southern point of the\r\n'b'islet, terminated by a sharp cape, and proceeded towards the north along\r\n'b'the western coast, equally formed by sand and rocks, the background\r\n'b'bordered with thick woods.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was not a trace of a habitation in any part, not the print of a\r\n'b'human foot on the shore of the island, which after four hours\xe2\x80\x99 walking\r\n'b'had been gone completely round.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was to say the least very extraordinary, and they were compelled to\r\n'b'believe that Tabor Island was not or was no longer inhabited. Perhaps,\r\n'b'after all the document was already several months or several years old,\r\n'b'and it was possible in this case, either that the castaway had been\r\n'b'enabled to return to his country, or that he had died of misery.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, Spilett, and Herbert, forming more or less probable\r\n'b'conjectures, dined rapidly on board the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d so as to be\r\n'b'able to continue their excursion until nightfall. This was done at five\r\n'b'o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, at which hour they entered the wood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Numerous animals fled at their approach, being principally, one might\r\n'b'say, only goats and pigs, which were obviously European species.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Doubtless some whaler had landed them on the island, where they had\r\n'b'rapidly increased. Herbert resolved to catch one or two living, and take\r\n'b'them back to Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was no longer doubtful that men at some period or other had visited\r\n'b'this islet, and this became still more evident when paths appeared\r\n'b'trodden through the forest, felled trees, and everywhere traces of the\r\n'b'hand of man; but the trees were becoming rotten, and had been felled\r\n'b'many years ago; the marks of the axe were velveted with moss, and the\r\n'b'grass grew long and thick on the paths, so that it was difficult to find\r\n'b'them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthis not only proves that men have\r\n'b'landed on the island, but also that they lived on it for some time. Now,\r\n'b'who were these men? How many of them remain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe document,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9conly spoke of one castaway.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, if he is still on the island,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cit is\r\n'b'impossible but that we shall find him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The exploration was continued. The sailor and his companions naturally\r\n'b'followed the route which cut diagonally across the island, and they were\r\n'b'thus obliged to follow the stream which flowed towards the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'If the animals of European origin, if works due to a human hand, showed\r\n'b'incontestably that men had already visited the island, several specimens\r\n'b'of the vegetable kingdom did not prove it less. In some places, in the\r\n'b'midst of clearings, it was evident that the soil had been planted with\r\n'b'culinary plants, at probably the same distant period.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What, then, was Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s joy, when he recognized potatoes, chicory,\r\n'b'sorrel, carrots, cabbages, and turnips, of which it was sufficient to\r\n'b'collect the seed to enrich the soil of Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCapital, jolly!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cThat will suit Neb as well as us.\r\n'b'Even if we do not find the castaway, at least our voyage will not have\r\n'b'been useless, and God will have rewarded us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut to see the state in which we\r\n'b'find these plantations, it is to be feared that the island has not been\r\n'b'inhabited for some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9can inhabitant, whoever he was, could not\r\n'b'have neglected such an important culture!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthe castaway has gone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must suppose so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt must then be admitted that the document has already a distant date?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEvidently.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that the bottle only arrived at Lincoln Island after having floated\r\n'b'in the sea a long time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cBut night is coming on,\xe2\x80\x9d added he, \xe2\x80\x9cand I\r\n'b'think that it will be best to give up the search for the present.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go on board, and to-morrow we will begin again,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\n'b'reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was the wisest course, and it was about to be followed when\r\n'b'Herbert, pointing to a confused mass among the trees, exclaimed,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA hut!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All three immediately ran towards the dwelling. In the twilight it was\r\n'b'just possible to see that it was built of planks and covered with a\r\n'b'thick tarpaulin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The half-closed door was pushed open by Pencroft, who entered with a\r\n'b'rapid step.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The hut was empty!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 14\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett remained silent in the midst of\r\n'b'the darkness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft shouted loudly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No reply was made.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor then struck a light and set fire to a twig. This lighted for\r\n'b'a minute a small room, which appeared perfectly empty. At the back was\r\n'b'a rude fireplace, with a few cold cinders, supporting an armful of dry\r\n'b'wood. Pencroft threw the blazing twig on it, the wood crackled and gave\r\n'b'forth a bright light.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor and his two companions then perceived a disordered bed, of\r\n'b'which the damp and yellow coverlets proved that it had not been used for\r\n'b'a long time. In the corner of the fireplace were two kettles, covered\r\n'b'with rust, and an overthrown pot. A cupboard, with a few moldy sailor\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'clothes; on the table a tin plate and a Bible, eaten away by damp; in a\r\n'b'corner a few tools, a spade, pickaxe, two fowling-pieces, one of which\r\n'b'was broken; on a plank, forming a shelf, stood a barrel of powder, still\r\n'b'untouched, a barrel of shot, and several boxes of caps, all thickly\r\n'b'covered with dust, accumulated, perhaps, by many long years.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no one here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo one,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a long time since this room has been inhabited,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\n'b'Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, a very long time!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d then said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cinstead of returning on board, I\r\n'b'think that it would be well to pass the night in this hut.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand if its owner\r\n'b'returns, well! perhaps he will not be sorry to find the place taken\r\n'b'possession of.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe will not return,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, shaking his head.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou think that he has quitted the island?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf he had quitted the island he would have taken away his weapons and\r\n'b'his tools,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know the value which castaways set\r\n'b'on such articles as these the last remains of a wreck. No! no!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated\r\n'b'the sailor, in a tone of conviction; \xe2\x80\x9cno, he has not left the island! If\r\n'b'he had escaped in a boat made by himself, he would still less have left\r\n'b'these indispensable and necessary articles. No! he is on the island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLiving?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLiving or dead. But if he is dead, I suppose he has not buried himself,\r\n'b'and so we shall at least find his remains!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was then agreed that the night should be passed in the deserted\r\n'b'dwelling, and a store of wood found in a corner was sufficient to warm\r\n'b'it. The door closed, Pencroft, Herbert and Spilett remained there,\r\n'b'seated on a bench, talking little but wondering much. They were in a\r\n'b'frame of mind to imagine anything or expect anything. They listened\r\n'b'eagerly for sounds outside. The door might have opened suddenly, and\r\n'b'a man presented himself to them without their being in the least\r\n'b'surprised, notwithstanding all that the hut revealed of abandonment,\r\n'b'and they had their hands ready to press the hands of this man, this\r\n'b'castaway, this unknown friend, for whom friends were waiting.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But no voice was heard, the door did not open. The hours thus passed\r\n'b'away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'How long the night appeared to the sailor and his companions! Herbert\r\n'b'alone slept for two hours, for at his age sleep is a necessity. They\r\n'b'were all three anxious to continue their exploration of the day before,\r\n'b'and to search the most secret recesses of the islet! The inferences\r\n'b'deduced by Pencroft were perfectly reasonable, and it was nearly certain\r\n'b'that, as the hut was deserted, and the tools, utensils, and weapons were\r\n'b'still there, the owner had succumbed. It was agreed, therefore, that\r\n'b'they should search for his remains, and give them at least Christian\r\n'b'burial.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Day dawned; Pencroft and his companions immediately proceeded to survey\r\n'b'the dwelling. It had certainly been built in a favorable situation,\r\n'b'at the back of a little hill, sheltered by five or six magnificent\r\n'b'gum-trees. Before its front and through the trees the axe had prepared\r\n'b'a wide clearing, which allowed the view to extend to the sea. Beyond a\r\n'b'lawn, surrounded by a wooden fence falling to pieces, was the shore, on\r\n'b'the left of which was the mouth of the stream.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The hut had been built of planks, and it was easy to see that these\r\n'b'planks had been obtained from the hull or deck of a ship. It was\r\n'b'probable that a disabled vessel had been cast on the coast of the\r\n'b'island, that one at least of the crew had been saved, and that by means\r\n'b'of the wreck this man, having tools at his disposal, had built the\r\n'b'dwelling.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And this became still more evident when Gideon Spilett, after having\r\n'b'walked around the hut, saw on a plank, probably one of those which\r\n'b'had formed the armor of the wrecked vessel, these letters already half\r\n'b'effaced:\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'              BR--TAN--A\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBritannia,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, whom the reporter had called; \xe2\x80\x9cit is\r\n'b'a common name for ships, and I could not say if she was English or\r\n'b'American!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters very little, Pencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery little indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand we will save the\r\n'b'survivor of her crew if he is still living, to whatever country he may\r\n'b'belong. But before beginning our search again let us go on board the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A sort of uneasiness had seized Pencroft upon the subject of his vessel.\r\n'b'Should the island be inhabited after all, and should some one have taken\r\n'b'possession of her? But he shrugged his shoulders at such an unreasonable\r\n'b'supposition. At any rate the sailor was not sorry to go to breakfast on\r\n'b'board. The road already trodden was not long, scarcely a mile. They set\r\n'b'out on their walk, gazing into the wood and thickets through which goats\r\n'b'and pigs fled in hundreds.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Twenty minutes after leaving the hut Pencroft and his companions reached\r\n'b'the western coast of the island, and saw the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d held fast by\r\n'b'her anchor, which was buried deep in the sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft could not restrain a sigh of satisfaction. After all this\r\n'b'vessel was his child, and it is the right of fathers to be often uneasy\r\n'b'when there is no occasion for it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They returned on board, breakfasted, so that it should not be necessary\r\n'b'to dine until very late; then the repast being ended, the exploration\r\n'b'was continued and conducted with the most minute care. Indeed, it was\r\n'b'very probable that the only inhabitant of the island had perished. It\r\n'b'was therefore more for the traces of a dead than of a living man that\r\n'b'Pencroft and his companions searched. But their searches were vain, and\r\n'b'during the half of that day they sought to no purpose among the thickets\r\n'b'of trees which covered the islet. There was then scarcely any doubt\r\n'b'that, if the castaway was dead, no trace of his body now remained, but\r\n'b'that some wild beast had probably devoured it to the last bone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will set off to-morrow at daybreak,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft to his two\r\n'b'companions, as about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock they were resting for a few minutes\r\n'b'under the shade of a clump of firs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI should think that we might without scruple take the utensils which\r\n'b'belonged to the castaway,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think so, too,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand these arms and tools\r\n'b'will make up the stores of Granite House. The supply of powder and shot\r\n'b'is also most important.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we must not forget to capture a couple or\r\n'b'two of those pigs, of which Lincoln Island is destitute.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNor to gather those seeds,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich will give us all the\r\n'b'vegetables of the Old and the New Worlds.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen perhaps it would be best,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cto remain a day\r\n'b'longer on Tabor Island, so as to collect all that may be useful to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI will ask you to set off\r\n'b'to-morrow at daybreak. The wind seems to me to be likely to shift to the\r\n'b'west, and after having had a fair wind for coming we shall have a fair\r\n'b'wind for going back.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen do not let us lose time,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, rising.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe won\xe2\x80\x99t waste time,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cYou, Herbert, go and gather\r\n'b'the seeds, which you know better than we do. While you do that, Mr.\r\n'b'Spilett and I will go and have a pig hunt, and even without Top I hope\r\n'b'we shall manage to catch a few!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert accordingly took the path which led towards the cultivated part\r\n'b'of the islet, while the sailor and the reporter entered the forest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Many specimens of the porcine race fled before them, and these animals,\r\n'b'which were singularly active, did not appear to be in a humor to allow\r\n'b'themselves to be approached.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, after an hour\xe2\x80\x99s chase, the hunters had just managed to get hold\r\n'b'of a couple lying in a thicket, when cries were heard resounding from\r\n'b'the north part of the island, With the cries were mingled terrible\r\n'b'yells, in which there was nothing human.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Gideon Spilett were at once on their feet, and the pigs\r\n'b'by this movement began to run away, at the moment when the sailor was\r\n'b'getting ready the rope to bind them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s voice,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRun!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor and Spilett immediately ran at full speed towards the\r\n'b'spot from whence the cries proceeded.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They did well to hasten, for at a turn of the path near a clearing they\r\n'b'saw the lad thrown on the ground and in the grasp of a savage being,\r\n'b'apparently a gigantic ape, who was about to do him some great harm.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To rush on this monster, throw him on the ground in his turn, snatch\r\n'b'Herbert from him, then bind him securely, was the work of a minute for\r\n'b'Pencroft and Gideon Spilett. The sailor was of Herculean strength, the\r\n'b'reporter also very powerful, and in spite of the monster\xe2\x80\x99s resistance he\r\n'b'was firmly tied so that he could not even move.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are not hurt, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if this ape had wounded him!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut he is not an ape,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At these words Pencroft and Gideon Spilett looked at the singular being\r\n'b'who lay on the ground. Indeed it was not an ape; it was a human being,\r\n'b'a man. But what a man! A savage in all the horrible acceptation of the\r\n'b'word, and so much the more frightful that he seemed fallen to the lowest\r\n'b'degree of brutishness!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Shaggy hair, untrimmed beard descending to the chest, the body almost\r\n'b'naked except a rag round the waist, wild eyes, enormous hands with\r\n'b'immensely long nails, skin the color of mahogany, feet as hard as if\r\n'b'made of horn, such was the miserable creature who yet had a claim to be\r\n'b'called a man. But it might justly be asked if there were yet a soul in\r\n'b'this body, or if the brute instinct alone survived in it!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you quite sure that this is a man, or that he has ever been one?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' said Pencroft to the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlas! there is no doubt about it,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen this must be the castaway?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut the unfortunate man has no longer\r\n'b'anything human about him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter spoke the truth. It was evident that if the castaway had\r\n'b'ever been a civilized being, solitude had made him a savage, or worse,\r\n'b'perhaps a regular man of the woods. Hoarse sounds issued from his throat\r\n'b'between his teeth, which were sharp as the teeth of a wild beast made to\r\n'b'tear raw flesh.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Memory must have deserted him long before, and for a long time also he\r\n'b'had forgotten how to use his gun and tools, and he no longer knew how to\r\n'b'make a fire! It could be seen that he was active and powerful, but the\r\n'b'physical qualities had been developed in him to the injury of the moral\r\n'b'qualities. Gideon Spilett spoke to him. He did not appear to understand\r\n'b'or even to hear. And yet on looking into his eyes, the reporter thought\r\n'b'he could see that all reason was not extinguished in him. However, the\r\n'b'prisoner did not struggle, nor even attempt to break his bonds. Was he\r\n'b'overwhelmed by the presence of men whose fellow he had once been? Had he\r\n'b'found in some corner of his brain a fleeting remembrance which recalled\r\n'b'him to humanity? If free, would he attempt to fly, or would he remain?\r\n'b'They could not tell, but they did not make the experiment; and after\r\n'b'gazing attentively at the miserable creature,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhoever he may be,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cwhoever he may have\r\n'b'been, and whatever he may become, it is our duty to take him with us to\r\n'b'Lincoln Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand perhaps with care we may arouse in him\r\n'b'some gleam of intelligence.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe soul does not die,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand it would be a great\r\n'b'satisfaction to rescue one of God\xe2\x80\x99s creatures from brutishness.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft shook his head doubtfully.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must try at any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the reporter; \xe2\x80\x9chumanity commands\r\n'b'us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was indeed their duty as Christians and civilized beings. All three\r\n'b'felt this, and they well knew that Cyrus Harding would approve of their\r\n'b'acting thus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShall we leave him bound?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps he would walk if his feet were unfastened,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cords which shackled the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s feet were cut off, but his arms\r\n'b'remained securely fastened. He got up by himself and did not manifest\r\n'b'any desire to run away. His hard eyes darted a piercing glance at the\r\n'b'three men, who walked near him, but nothing denoted that he recollected\r\n'b'being their fellow, or at least having been so. A continual hissing\r\n'b'sound issued from his lips, his aspect was wild, but he did not attempt\r\n'b'to resist.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'By the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s advice the unfortunate man was taken to the hut.\r\n'b'Perhaps the sight of the things that belonged to him would make some\r\n'b'impression on him! Perhaps a spark would be sufficient to revive his\r\n'b'obscured intellect, to rekindle his dulled soul. The dwelling was\r\n'b'not far off. In a few minutes they arrived there, but the prisoner\r\n'b'remembered nothing, and it appeared that he had lost consciousness of\r\n'b'everything.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What could they think of the degree of brutishness into which this\r\n'b'miserable being had fallen, unless that his imprisonment on the islet\r\n'b'dated from a very distant period and after having arrived there a\r\n'b'rational being solitude had reduced him to this condition.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter then thought that perhaps the sight of fire would have\r\n'b'some effect on him, and in a moment one of those beautiful flames, that\r\n'b'attract even animals, blazed up on the hearth. The sight of the flame\r\n'b'seemed at first to fix the attention of the unhappy object, but soon\r\n'b'he turned away and the look of intelligence faded. Evidently there was\r\n'b'nothing to be done, for the time at least, but to take him on board\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d This was done, and he remained there in Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'charge.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert and Spilett returned to finish their work; and some hours after\r\n'b'they came back to the shore, carrying the utensils and guns, a store of\r\n'b'vegetables, of seeds, some game, and two couple of pigs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All was embarked, and the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was ready to weigh anchor and\r\n'b'sail with the morning tide.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The prisoner had been placed in the fore-cabin, where he remained quiet,\r\n'b'silent, apparently deaf and dumb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft offered him something to eat, but he pushed away the cooked\r\n'b'meat that was presented to him and which doubtless did not suit him. But\r\n'b'on the sailor showing him one of the ducks which Herbert had killed, he\r\n'b'pounced on it like a wild beast, and devoured it greedily.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou think that he will recover his senses?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is\r\n'b'not impossible that our care will have an effect upon him, for it is\r\n'b'solitude that has made him what he is, and from this time forward he\r\n'b'will be no longer alone.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe poor man must no doubt have been in this state for a long time,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout what age is he?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lad.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is difficult to say,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is impossible to\r\n'b'see his features under the thick beard which covers his face, but he is\r\n'b'no longer young, and I suppose he might be about fifty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave you noticed, Mr. Spilett, how deeply sunk his eyes are?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\n'b'Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Herbert, but I must add that they are more human than one could\r\n'b'expect from his appearance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, we shall see,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand I am anxious to know\r\n'b'what opinion Captain Harding will have of our savage. We went to look\r\n'b'for a human creature, and we are bringing back a monster! After all, we\r\n'b'did what we could.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night passed, and whether the prisoner slept or not could not be\r\n'b'known, but at any rate, although he had been unbound, he did not\r\n'b'move. He was like a wild animal, which appears stunned at first by its\r\n'b'capture, and becomes wild again afterwards.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At daybreak the next morning, the 15th of October, the change of weather\r\n'b'predicted by Pencroft occurred. The wind having shifted to the northwest\r\n'b'favored the return of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d but at the same time it\r\n'b'freshened, which might render navigation more difficult.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the anchor was weighed. Pencroft took a\r\n'b'reef in the mainsail, and steered towards the north-east, so as to sail\r\n'b'straight for Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first day of the voyage was not marked by any incident. The prisoner\r\n'b'remained quiet in the fore-cabin, and as he had been a sailor it\r\n'b'appeared that the motion of the vessel might produce on him a salutary\r\n'b'reaction. Did some recollection of his former calling return to him?\r\n'b'However that might be, he remained tranquil, astonished rather than\r\n'b'depressed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day the wind increased, blowing more from the north,\r\n'b'consequently in a less favorable direction for the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' Pencroft was soon obliged to sail close-hauled, and without saying\r\n'b'anything about it he began to be uneasy at the state of the sea, which\r\n'b'frequently broke over the bows. Certainly, if the wind did not moderate,\r\n'b'it would take a longer time to reach Lincoln Island than it had taken to\r\n'b'make Tabor Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Indeed, on the morning of the 17th, the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d had been\r\n'b'forty-eight hours at sea, and nothing showed that she was near the\r\n'b'island. It was impossible, besides, to estimate the distance traversed,\r\n'b'or to trust to the reckoning for the direction, as the speed had been\r\n'b'very irregular.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Twenty-four hours after there was yet no land in sight. The wind was\r\n'b'right ahead and the sea very heavy. The sails were close-reefed, and\r\n'b'they tacked frequently. On the 18th, a wave swept completely over the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d; and if the crew had not taken the precaution of lashing\r\n'b'themselves to the deck, they would have been carried away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this occasion Pencroft and his companions, who were occupied with\r\n'b'loosing themselves, received unexpected aid from the prisoner, who\r\n'b'emerged from the hatchway as if his sailor\xe2\x80\x99s instinct had suddenly\r\n'b'returned, broke a piece out of the bulwarks with a spar so as to let\r\n'b'the water which filled the deck escape. Then the vessel being clear, he\r\n'b'descended to his cabin without having uttered a word. Pencroft, Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, and Herbert, greatly astonished, let him proceed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their situation was truly serious, and the sailor had reason to fear\r\n'b'that he was lost on the wide sea without any possibility of recovering\r\n'b'his course.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night was dark and cold. However, about eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the wind\r\n'b'fell, the sea went down, and the speed of the vessel, as she labored\r\n'b'less, greatly increased.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neither Pencroft, Spilett, nor Herbert thought of taking an hour\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'sleep. They kept a sharp look-out, for either Lincoln Island could not\r\n'b'be far distant and would be sighted at daybreak, or the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' carried away by currents, had drifted so much that it would be\r\n'b'impossible to rectify her course. Pencroft, uneasy to the last degree,\r\n'b'yet did not despair, for he had a gallant heart, and grasping the tiller\r\n'b'he anxiously endeavored to pierce the darkness which surrounded them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning he started forward,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA light! a light!\xe2\x80\x9d he shouted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Indeed, a bright light appeared twenty miles to the northeast. Lincoln\r\n'b'Island was there, and this fire, evidently lighted by Cyrus Harding,\r\n'b'showed them the course to be followed. Pencroft, who was bearing too\r\n'b'much to the north, altered his course and steered towards the fire,\r\n'b'which burned brightly above the horizon like a star of the first\r\n'b'magnitude.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 15\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 20th of October, at seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning,\r\n'b'after a voyage of four days, the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d gently glided up to the\r\n'b'beach at the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Neb, who had become very uneasy at the bad weather and\r\n'b'the prolonged absence of their companions, had climbed at daybreak to\r\n'b'the plateau of Prospect Heights, and they had at last caught sight of\r\n'b'the vessel which had been so long in returning.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised! there they are!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to Neb in his joy, he began to dance, to twirl round, clapping his\r\n'b'hands and shouting, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! my master!\xe2\x80\x9d A more touching pantomime than the\r\n'b'finest discourse.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s first idea, on counting the people on the deck of the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d was that Pencroft had not found the castaway of Tabor\r\n'b'Island, or at any rate that the unfortunate man had refused to leave his\r\n'b'island and change one prison for another.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Indeed Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert were alone on the deck of\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The moment the vessel touched, the engineer and Neb were waiting on\r\n'b'the beach, and before the passengers had time to leap on to the sand,\r\n'b'Harding said: \xe2\x80\x9cWe have been very uneasy at your delay, my friends! Did\r\n'b'you meet with any accident?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett; \xe2\x80\x9con the contrary, everything went\r\n'b'wonderfully well. We will tell you all about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cyour search has been unsuccessful,\r\n'b'since you are only three, just as you went!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cExcuse me, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are four.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have found the castaway?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you have brought him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLiving?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere is he? Who is he?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe is,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cor rather he was a man! There, Cyrus,\r\n'b'that is all we can tell you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer was then informed of all that had passed during the voyage,\r\n'b'and under what conditions the search had been conducted; how the only\r\n'b'dwelling in the island had long been abandoned; how at last a castaway\r\n'b'had been captured, who appeared no longer to belong to the human\r\n'b'species.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that\xe2\x80\x99s just the point,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know if we have\r\n'b'done right to bring him here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly you have, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer quickly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut the wretched creature has no sense!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is possible at present,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cbut only a few\r\n'b'months ago the wretched creature was a man like you and me. And who\r\n'b'knows what will become of the survivor of us after a long solitude on\r\n'b'this island? It is a great misfortune to be alone, my friends; and it\r\n'b'must be believed that solitude can quickly destroy reason, since you\r\n'b'have found this poor creature in such a state!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat leads you to think that the\r\n'b'brutishness of the unfortunate man began only a few months back?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the document we found had been recently written,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\n'b'engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand the castaway alone can have written it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlways supposing,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it had not been\r\n'b'written by a companion of this man, since dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is impossible, my dear Spilett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the document would then have spoken of two castaways,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\n'b'Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand it mentioned only one.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert then in a few words related the incidents of the voyage, and\r\n'b'dwelt on the curious fact of the sort of passing gleam in the prisoner\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'mind, when for an instant in the height of the storm he had become a\r\n'b'sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right to attach great\r\n'b'importance to this fact. The unfortunate man cannot be incurable, and\r\n'b'despair has made him what he is; but here he will find his fellow-men,\r\n'b'and since there is still a soul in him, this soul we shall save!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The castaway of Tabor Island, to the great pity of the engineer and\r\n'b'the great astonishment of Neb, was then brought from the cabin which he\r\n'b'occupied in the fore part of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d; when once on land he\r\n'b'manifested a wish to run away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But Cyrus Harding approaching, placed his hand on his shoulder with a\r\n'b'gesture full of authority, and looked at him with infinite tenderness.\r\n'b'Immediately the unhappy man, submitting to a superior will, gradually\r\n'b'became calm, his eyes fell, his head bent, and he made no more\r\n'b'resistance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had attentively observed him. To judge by his appearance\r\n'b'this miserable being had no longer anything human about him, and\r\n'b'yet Harding, as had the reporter already, observed in his look an\r\n'b'indefinable trace of intelligence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was decided that the castaway, or rather the stranger as he was\r\n'b'thenceforth termed by his companions, should live in one of the rooms\r\n'b'of Granite House, from which, however, he could not escape. He was led\r\n'b'there without difficulty, and with careful attention, it might, perhaps,\r\n'b'be hoped that some day he would be a companion to the settlers in\r\n'b'Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, during breakfast, which Neb had hastened to prepare,\r\n'b'as the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft were dying of hunger, heard in\r\n'b'detail all the incidents which had marked the voyage of exploration to\r\n'b'the islet. He agreed with his friends on this point, that the stranger\r\n'b'must be either English or American, the name Britannia leading them\r\n'b'to suppose this, and, besides, through the bushy beard, and under\r\n'b'the shaggy, matted hair, the engineer thought he could recognize the\r\n'b'characteristic features of the Anglo-Saxon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, by the bye,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, addressing Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cyou never\r\n'b'told us how you met this savage, and we know nothing, except that you\r\n'b'would have been strangled, if we had not happened to come up in time to\r\n'b'help you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUpon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cit is rather difficult to say how it\r\n'b'happened. I was, I think, occupied in collecting my plants, when I heard\r\n'b'a noise like an avalanche falling from a very tall tree. I scarcely\r\n'b'had time to look round. This unfortunate man, who was without doubt\r\n'b'concealed in a tree, rushed upon me in less time than I take to tell you\r\n'b'about it, and unless Mr. Spilett and Pencroft--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy boy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cyou ran a great danger, but, perhaps,\r\n'b'without that, the poor creature would have still hidden himself from\r\n'b'your search, and we should not have had a new companion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou hope, then, Cyrus, to succeed in reforming the man?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the\r\n'b'reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Breakfast over, Harding and his companions left Granite House and\r\n'b'returned to the beach. They there occupied themselves in unloading the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d and the engineer, having examined the arms and tools,\r\n'b'saw nothing which could help them to establish the identity of the\r\n'b'stranger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The capture of pigs, made on the islet, was looked upon as being very\r\n'b'profitable to Lincoln Island, and the animals were led to the sty, where\r\n'b'they soon became at home.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The two barrels, containing the powder and shot, as well as the box\r\n'b'of caps, were very welcome. It was agreed to establish a small\r\n'b'powder-magazine, either outside Granite House or in the Upper Cavern,\r\n'b'where there would be no fear of explosion. However, the use of pyroxyle\r\n'b'was to be continued, for this substance giving excellent results, there\r\n'b'was no reason for substituting ordinary powder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When the unloading of the vessel was finished,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI think it would be prudent to put our\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 in a safe place.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs she not safe at the mouth of the Mercy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cHalf of the time she is stranded on\r\n'b'the sand, and that works her. She is a famous craft, you see, and she\r\n'b'behaved admirably during the squall which struck us on our return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCould she not float in the river?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, captain, she could; but there is no shelter there, and in the\r\n'b'east winds, I think that the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 would suffer much from the\r\n'b'surf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, where would you put her, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn Port Balloon,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cThat little creek, shut in by\r\n'b'rocks, seems to me to be just the harbor we want.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs it not rather far?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! it is not more than three miles from Granite House, and we have a\r\n'b'fine straight road to take us there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo it then, Pencroft, and take your \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 there,\xe2\x80\x9d replied\r\n'b'the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet I would rather have her under our more immediate\r\n'b'protection. When we have time, we must make a little harbor for her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFamous!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cA harbor with a lighthouse, a pier, and\r\n'b'dock! Ah! really with you, captain, everything becomes easy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, my brave Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut on condition,\r\n'b'however, that you help me, for you do as much as three men in all our\r\n'b'work.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert and the sailor then re-embarked on board the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' the anchor was weighed, the sail hoisted, and the wind drove her rapidly\r\n'b'towards Claw Cape. Two hours after, she was reposing on the tranquil\r\n'b'waters of Port Balloon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the first days passed by the stranger in Granite House, had he\r\n'b'already given them reason to think that his savage nature was becoming\r\n'b'tamed? Did a brighter light burn in the depths of that obscured mind? In\r\n'b'short, was the soul returning to the body?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Yes, to a certainty, and to such a degree, that Cyrus Harding and the\r\n'b'reporter wondered if the reason of the unfortunate man had ever been\r\n'b'totally extinguished. At first, accustomed to the open air, to the\r\n'b'unrestrained liberty which he had enjoyed on Tabor Island, the stranger\r\n'b'manifested a sullen fury, and it was feared that he might throw\r\n'b'himself onto the beach, out of one of the windows of Granite House.\r\n'b'But gradually he became calmer, and more freedom was allowed to his\r\n'b'movements.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had reason to hope, and to hope much. Already, forgetting his\r\n'b'carnivorous instincts, the stranger accepted a less bestial nourishment\r\n'b'than that on which he fed on the islet, and cooked meat did not produce\r\n'b'in him the same sentiment of repulsion which he had showed on board\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d Cyrus Harding had profited by a moment when he was\r\n'b'sleeping, to cut his hair and matted beard, which formed a sort of\r\n'b'mane and gave him such a savage aspect. He had also been clothed more\r\n'b'suitably, after having got rid of the rag which covered him. The result\r\n'b'was that, thanks to these attentions, the stranger resumed a more\r\n'b'human appearance, and it even seemed as if his eyes had become milder.\r\n'b'Certainly, when formerly lighted up by intelligence, this man\xe2\x80\x99s face\r\n'b'must have had a sort of beauty.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Every day, Harding imposed on himself the task of passing some hours\r\n'b'in his company. He came and worked near him, and occupied himself in\r\n'b'different things, so as to fix his attention. A spark, indeed, would be\r\n'b'sufficient to reillumine that soul, a recollection crossing that brain\r\n'b'to recall reason. That had been seen, during the storm, on board the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure!\xe2\x80\x9d The engineer did not neglect either to speak aloud, so\r\n'b'as to penetrate at the same time by the organs of hearing and sight the\r\n'b'depths of that torpid intelligence. Sometimes one of his companions,\r\n'b'sometimes another, sometimes all joined him. They spoke most often of\r\n'b'things belonging to the navy, which must interest a sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At times, the stranger gave some slight attention to what was said,\r\n'b'and the settlers were soon convinced that he partly understood them.\r\n'b'Sometimes the expression of his countenance was deeply sorrowful, a\r\n'b'proof that he suffered mentally, for his face could not be mistaken;\r\n'b'but he did not speak, although at different times, however, they almost\r\n'b'thought that words were about to issue from his lips. At all events, the\r\n'b'poor creature was quite quiet and sad!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But was not his calm only apparent? Was not his sadness only the result\r\n'b'of his seclusion? Nothing could yet be ascertained. Seeing only certain\r\n'b'objects and in a limited space, always in contact with the colonists,\r\n'b'to whom he would soon become accustomed, having no desires to satisfy,\r\n'b'better fed, better clothed, it was natural that his physical nature\r\n'b'should gradually improve; but was he penetrated with the sense of a new\r\n'b'life? or rather, to employ a word which would be exactly applicable\r\n'b'to him, was he not becoming tamed, like an animal in company with his\r\n'b'master? This was an important question, which Cyrus Harding was anxious\r\n'b'to answer, and yet he did not wish to treat his invalid roughly! Would\r\n'b'he ever be a convalescent?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'How the engineer observed him every moment! How he was on the watch for\r\n'b'his soul, if one may use the expression! How he was ready to grasp it!\r\n'b'The settlers followed with real sympathy all the phases of the cure\r\n'b'undertaken by Harding. They aided him also in this work of humanity, and\r\n'b'all, except perhaps the incredulous Pencroft, soon shared both his hope\r\n'b'and his faith.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The calm of the stranger was deep, as has been said, and he even showed\r\n'b'a sort of attachment for the engineer, whose influence he evidently\r\n'b'felt. Cyrus Harding resolved then to try him, by transporting him\r\n'b'to another scene, from that ocean which formerly his eyes had been\r\n'b'accustomed to contemplate, to the border of the forest, which might\r\n'b'perhaps recall those where so many years of his life had been passed!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9ccan we hope that he will not escape, if\r\n'b'once set at liberty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe experiment must be tried,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen that fellow is outside, and feels the fresh\r\n'b'air, he will be off as fast as his legs can carry him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think so,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will try,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was on the 30th of October, and consequently the castaway of Tabor\r\n'b'Island had been a prisoner in Granite House for nine days. It was\r\n'b'warm, and a bright sun darted its rays on the island. Cyrus Harding and\r\n'b'Pencroft went to the room occupied by the stranger, who was found lying\r\n'b'near the window and gazing at the sky.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer to him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger rose immediately. His eyes were fixed on Cyrus Harding, and\r\n'b'he followed him, while the sailor marched behind them, little confident\r\n'b'as to the result of the experiment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Arrived at the door, Harding and Pencroft made him take his place in\r\n'b'the lift, while Neb, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett waited for them before\r\n'b'Granite House. The lift descended, and in a few moments all were united\r\n'b'on the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers went a short distance from the stranger, so as to leave him\r\n'b'at liberty.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He then made a few steps toward the sea, and his look brightened with\r\n'b'extreme animation, but he did not make the slightest attempt to escape.\r\n'b'He was gazing at the little waves which, broken by the islet, rippled on\r\n'b'the sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is only the sea,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand possibly it does\r\n'b'not inspire him with any wish to escape!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must take him to the plateau, on the border\r\n'b'of the forest. There the experiment will be more conclusive.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, he could not run away,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, \xe2\x80\x9csince the bridge is\r\n'b'raised.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat isn\xe2\x80\x99t a man to be troubled by a stream like\r\n'b'Creek Glycerine! He could cross it directly, at a single bound!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall soon see,\xe2\x80\x9d Harding contented himself with replying, his eyes\r\n'b'not quitting those of his patient.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The latter was then led towards the mouth of the Mercy, and all climbing\r\n'b'the left bank of the river, reached Prospect Heights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Arrived at the spot on which grew the first beautiful trees of the\r\n'b'forest, their foliage slightly agitated by the breeze, the stranger\r\n'b'appeared greedily to drink in the penetrating odor which filled the\r\n'b'atmosphere, and a long sigh escaped from his chest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers kept behind him, ready to seize him if he made any movement\r\n'b'to escape!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, indeed, the poor creature was on the point of springing into the\r\n'b'creek which separated him from the forest, and his legs were bent for an\r\n'b'instant as if for a spring, but almost immediately he stepped back, half\r\n'b'sank down, and a large tear fell from his eyes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have become a man again, for you can\r\n'b'weep!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 16\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Yes! the unfortunate man had wept! Some recollection doubtless had\r\n'b'flashed across his brain, and to use Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s expression, by\r\n'b'those tears he was once more a man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists left him for some time on the plateau, and withdrew\r\n'b'themselves to a short distance, so that he might feel himself free; but\r\n'b'he did not think of profiting by this liberty, and Harding soon brought\r\n'b'him back to Granite House. Two days after this occurrence, the stranger\r\n'b'appeared to wish gradually to mingle with their common life. He\r\n'b'evidently heard and understood, but no less evidently was he strangely\r\n'b'determined not to speak to the colonists; for one evening, Pencroft,\r\n'b'listening at the door of his room, heard these words escape from his\r\n'b'lips:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo! here! I! never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor reported these words to his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is some painful mystery there!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger had begun to use the laboring tools, and he worked in the\r\n'b'garden. When he stopped in his work, as was often the case, he remained\r\n'b'retired within himself, but on the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s recommendation, they\r\n'b'respected the reserve which he apparently wished to keep. If one of the\r\n'b'settlers approached him, he drew back, and his chest heaved with sobs,\r\n'b'as if overburdened!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Was it remorse that overwhelmed him thus? They were compelled to believe\r\n'b'so, and Gideon Spilett could not help one day making this observation,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf he does not speak it is because he has, I fear, things too serious\r\n'b'to be told!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They must be patient and wait.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few days later, on the 3rd of November, the stranger, working on the\r\n'b'plateau, had stopped, letting his spade drop to the ground, and Harding,\r\n'b'who was observing him from a little distance, saw that tears were again\r\n'b'flowing from his eyes. A sort of irresistible pity led him towards the\r\n'b'unfortunate man, and he touched his arm lightly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger tried to avoid his look, and Cyrus Harding having\r\n'b'endeavored to take his hand, he drew back quickly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding in a firmer voice, \xe2\x80\x9clook at me, I wish it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger looked at the engineer, and seemed to be under his power,\r\n'b'as a subject under the influence of a mesmerist. He wished to run away.\r\n'b'But then his countenance suddenly underwent a transformation. His eyes\r\n'b'flashed. Words struggled to escape from his lips. He could no longer\r\n'b'contain himself! At last he folded his arms; then, in a hollow\r\n'b'voice,--\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCastaways, like you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, whose emotion was deep. \xe2\x80\x9cWe\r\n'b'have brought you here, among your fellow-men.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy fellow-men!.... I have none!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are in the midst of friends.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFriends!--for me! friends!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the stranger, hiding his face in\r\n'b'his hands. \xe2\x80\x9cNo--never--leave me! leave me!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then he rushed to the side of the plateau which overlooked the sea, and\r\n'b'remained there a long time motionless.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding rejoined his companions and related to them what had just\r\n'b'happened.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! there is some mystery in that man\xe2\x80\x99s life,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cand it appears as if he had only re-entered society by the path of\r\n'b'remorse.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know what sort of a man we have brought here,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe has secrets--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhich we will respect,\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Cyrus Harding quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cIf he has\r\n'b'committed any crime, he has most fearfully expiated it, and in our eyes\r\n'b'he is absolved.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For two hours the stranger remained alone on the shore, evidently under\r\n'b'the influence of recollections which recalled all his past life--a\r\n'b'melancholy life doubtless--and the colonists, without losing sight of\r\n'b'him, did not attempt to disturb his solitude. However, after two hours,\r\n'b'appearing to have formed a resolution, he came to find Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'His eyes were red with the tears he had shed, but he wept no longer.\r\n'b'His countenance expressed deep humility. He appeared anxious, timorous,\r\n'b'ashamed, and his eyes were constantly fixed on the ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cyour companions and you, are you English?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are Americans.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said the stranger, and he murmured, \xe2\x80\x9cI prefer that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEnglish,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he hastily.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And as if these few words had been difficult to say, he retreated to the\r\n'b'beach, where he walked up and down between the cascade and the mouth of\r\n'b'the Mercy, in a state of extreme agitation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, passing one moment close to Herbert, he stopped and in a stifled\r\n'b'voice,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat month?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDecember,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat year?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9c1866.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve years! twelve years!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then he left him abruptly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert reported to the colonists the questions and answers which had\r\n'b'been made.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis unfortunate man,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cwas no longer\r\n'b'acquainted with either months or years!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand he had been twelve years already on the islet\r\n'b'when we found him there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTwelve years!\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cAh! twelve years of solitude, after a\r\n'b'wicked life, perhaps, may well impair a man\xe2\x80\x99s reason!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am induced to think,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this man was not wrecked\r\n'b'on Tabor Island, but that in consequence of some crime he was left\r\n'b'there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be right, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand if it is so\r\n'b'it is not impossible that those who left him on the island may return to\r\n'b'fetch him some day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd they will no longer find him,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut then,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthey must return, and--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cdo not let us discuss this question\r\n'b'until we know more about it. I believe that the unhappy man has\r\n'b'suffered, that he has severely expiated his faults, whatever they may\r\n'b'have been, and that the wish to unburden himself stifles him. Do not let\r\n'b'us press him to tell us his history! He will tell it to us doubtless,\r\n'b'and when we know it, we shall see what course it will be best to follow.\r\n'b'He alone besides can tell us, if he has more than a hope, a certainty,\r\n'b'of returning some day to his country, but I doubt it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause that, in the event of his being sure of being delivered at a\r\n'b'certain time, he would have waited the hour of his deliverance and would\r\n'b'not have thrown this document into the sea. No, it is more probable that\r\n'b'he was condemned to die on that islet, and that he never expected to see\r\n'b'his fellow-creatures again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthere is one thing which I cannot explain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf this man had been left for twelve years on Tabor Island, one may\r\n'b'well suppose that he had been several years already in the wild state in\r\n'b'which we found him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is probable,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt must then be many years since he wrote that document!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d and yet the document appears to have been recently written!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, how do you know that the bottle which enclosed the document\r\n'b'may not have taken several years to come from Tabor Island to Lincoln\r\n'b'Island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not absolutely impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMight it not have been a long time already on the coast of the island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it was still floating. We could not even\r\n'b'suppose that after it had stayed for any length of time on the shore, it\r\n'b'would have been swept off by the sea, for the south coast is all rocks,\r\n'b'and it would certainly have been smashed to pieces there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Cyrus Harding thoughtfully.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cif the document was several years\r\n'b'old, if it had been shut up in that bottle for several years, it would\r\n'b'have been injured by damp. Now, there is nothing of the kind, and it was\r\n'b'found in a perfect state of preservation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning was very just, and pointed out an\r\n'b'incomprehensible fact, for the document appeared to have been recently\r\n'b'written, when the colonists found it in the bottle. Moreover, it gave\r\n'b'the latitude and longitude of Tabor Island correctly, which implied that\r\n'b'its author had a more complete knowledge of hydrography than could be\r\n'b'expected of a common sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is in this, again, something unaccountable,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cbut we will not urge our companion to speak. When he likes, my\r\n'b'friends, then we shall be ready to hear him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the following days the stranger did not speak a word, and did not\r\n'b'once leave the precincts of the plateau. He worked away, without losing\r\n'b'a moment, without taking a minute\xe2\x80\x99s rest, but always in a retired place.\r\n'b'At meal times he never came to Granite House, although invited several\r\n'b'times to do so, but contented himself with eating a few raw vegetables.\r\n'b'At nightfall he did not return to the room assigned to him, but remained\r\n'b'under some clump of trees, or when the weather was bad crouched in some\r\n'b'cleft of the rocks. Thus he lived in the same manner as when he had no\r\n'b'other shelter than the forests of Tabor Island, and as all persuasion\r\n'b'to induce him to improve his life was in vain, the colonists\r\n'b'waited patiently. And the time was near, when, as it seemed, almost\r\n'b'involuntarily urged by his conscience, a terrible confession escaped\r\n'b'him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 10th of November, about eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, as night\r\n'b'was coming on, the stranger appeared unexpectedly before the settlers,\r\n'b'who were assembled under the veranda. His eyes burned strangely, and he\r\n'b'had quite resumed the wild aspect of his worst days.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions were astounded on seeing that, overcome\r\n'b'by some terrible emotion, his teeth chattered like those of a person\r\n'b'in a fever. What was the matter with him? Was the sight of his\r\n'b'fellow-creatures insupportable to him? Was he weary of this return to a\r\n'b'civilized mode of existence? Was he pining for his former savage\r\n'b'life? It appeared so, as soon he was heard to express himself in these\r\n'b'incoherent sentences:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy am I here?.... By what right have you dragged me from my islet?....\r\n'b'Do you think there could be any tie between you and me?.... Do you know\r\n'b'who I am--what I have done--why I was there--alone? And who told\r\n'b'you that I was not abandoned there--that I was not condemned to die\r\n'b'there?.... Do you know my past?.... How do you know that I have not\r\n'b'stolen, murdered--that I am not a wretch--an accursed being--only fit to\r\n'b'live like a wild beast, far from all--speak--do you know it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists listened without interrupting the miserable creature, from\r\n'b'whom these broken confessions escaped, as it were, in spite of himself.\r\n'b'Harding wishing to calm him, approached him, but he hastily drew back.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed; \xe2\x80\x9cone word only--am I free?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are free,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFarewell, then!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, and fled like a madman.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert ran also towards the edge of the wood--but\r\n'b'they returned alone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must let him alone!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe will never come back!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe will come back,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Many days passed; but Harding--was it a sort of\r\n'b'presentiment?--persisted in the fixed idea that sooner or later the\r\n'b'unhappy man would return.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the last revolt of his wild nature,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhich remorse has\r\n'b'touched, and which renewed solitude will terrify.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, works of all sorts were continued, as well on Prospect\r\n'b'Heights as at the corral, where Harding intended to build a farm. It is\r\n'b'unnecessary to say that the seeds collected by Herbert on Tabor\r\n'b'Island had been carefully sown. The plateau thus formed one immense\r\n'b'kitchen-garden, well laid out and carefully tended, so that the arms of\r\n'b'the settlers were never in want of work. There was always something to\r\n'b'be done. As the esculents increased in number, it became necessary to\r\n'b'enlarge the simple beds, which threatened to grow into regular fields\r\n'b'and replace the meadows. But grass abounded in other parts of the\r\n'b'island, and there was no fear of the onagers being obliged to go on\r\n'b'short allowance. It was well worth while, besides, to turn Prospect\r\n'b'Heights into a kitchen-garden, defended by its deep belt of creeks, and\r\n'b'to remove them to the meadows, which had no need of protection against\r\n'b'the depredations of quadrumana and quadrapeds.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 15th of November, the third harvest was gathered in. How\r\n'b'wonderfully had the field increased in extent, since eighteen months\r\n'b'ago, when the first grain of wheat was sown! The second crop of six\r\n'b'hundred thousand grains produced this time four thousand bushels, or\r\n'b'five hundred millions of grains!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colony was rich in corn, for ten bushels alone were sufficient for\r\n'b'sowing every year to produce an ample crop for the food both of men and\r\n'b'beasts. The harvest was completed, and the last fortnight of the month\r\n'b'of November was devoted to the work of converting it into food for man.\r\n'b'In fact, they had corn, but not flour, and the establishment of a mill\r\n'b'was necessary. Cyrus Harding could have utilized the second fall which\r\n'b'flowed into the Mercy to establish his motive power, the first\r\n'b'being already occupied with moving the felting mill, but, after some\r\n'b'consultation, it was decided that a simple windmill should be built on\r\n'b'Prospect Heights. The building of this presented no more difficulty than\r\n'b'the building of the former, and it was moreover certain that there would\r\n'b'be no want of wind on the plateau, exposed as it was to the sea breezes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot to mention,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the windmill will be more lively\r\n'b'and will have a good effect in the landscape!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They set to work by choosing timber for the frame and machinery of the\r\n'b'mill. Some large stones, found at the north of the lake, could be easily\r\n'b'transformed into millstones, and as to the sails, the inexhaustible case\r\n'b'of the balloon furnished the necessary material.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding made his model, and the site of the mill was chosen a\r\n'b'little to the right of the poultry-yard, near the shore of the lake. The\r\n'b'frame was to rest on a pivot supported with strong timbers, so that it\r\n'b'could turn with all the machinery it contained according as the wind\r\n'b'required it. The work advanced rapidly. Neb and Pencroft had become\r\n'b'very skilful carpenters, and had nothing to do but to copy the models\r\n'b'provided by the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Soon a sort of cylindrical box, in shape like a pepper-pot, with a\r\n'b'pointed roof, rose on the spot chosen. The four frames which formed the\r\n'b'sails had been firmly fixed in the center beam, so as to form a certain\r\n'b'angle with it, and secured with iron clamps. As to the different\r\n'b'parts of the internal mechanism, the box destined to contain the two\r\n'b'millstones, the fixed stone and the moving stone, the hopper, a sort of\r\n'b'large square trough, wide at the top, narrow at the bottom, which would\r\n'b'allow the grain to fall on the stones, the oscillating spout intended to\r\n'b'regulate the passing of the grain, and lastly the bolting machine, which\r\n'b'by the operation of sifting, separates the bran from the flour,\r\n'b'were made without difficulty. The tools were good, and the work not\r\n'b'difficult, for in reality, the machinery of a mill is very simple. This\r\n'b'was only a question of time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Every one had worked at the construction of the mill, and on the 1st\r\n'b'of December it was finished. As usual, Pencroft was delighted with his\r\n'b'work, and had no doubt that the apparatus was perfect.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow for a good wind,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cand we shall grind our first harvest\r\n'b'splendidly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA good wind, certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut not too much,\r\n'b'Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! our mill would only go the faster!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is no need for it to go so very fast,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\n'b'is known by experience that the greatest quantity of work is performed\r\n'b'by a mill when the number of turns made by the sails in a minute is six\r\n'b'times the number of feet traversed by the wind in a second. A moderate\r\n'b'breeze, which passes over twenty-four feet to the second, will give\r\n'b'sixteen turns to the sails during a minute, and there is no need of\r\n'b'more.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cExactly!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9ca fine breeze is blowing from the northeast,\r\n'b'which will soon do our business for us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no reason for delaying the inauguration of the mill, for the\r\n'b'settlers were eager to taste the first piece of bread in Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'On this morning two or three bushels of wheat were ground, and the next\r\n'b'day at breakfast a magnificent loaf, a little heavy perhaps, although\r\n'b'raised with yeast, appeared on the table at Granite House. Every one\r\n'b'munched away at it with a pleasure which may be easily understood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, the stranger had not reappeared. Several times Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett and Herbert searched the forest in the neighborhood of Granite\r\n'b'House, without meeting or finding any trace of him. They became\r\n'b'seriously uneasy at this prolonged absence. Certainly, the former\r\n'b'savage of Tabor island could not be perplexed how to live in the forest,\r\n'b'abounding in game, but was it not to be feared that he had resumed his\r\n'b'habits, and that this freedom would revive in him his wild instincts?\r\n'b'However, Harding, by a sort of presentiment, doubtless, always persisted\r\n'b'in saying that the fugitive would return.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, he will return!\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated with a confidence which his\r\n'b'companions could not share. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen this unfortunate man was on Tabor\r\n'b'Island, he knew himself to be alone! Here, he knows that fellow-men are\r\n'b'awaiting him! Since he has partially spoken of his past life, the poor\r\n'b'penitent will return to tell the whole, and from that day he will belong\r\n'b'to us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The event justified Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s predictions. On the 3rd of December,\r\n'b'Herbert had left the plateau to go and fish on the southern bank of the\r\n'b'lake. He was unarmed, and till then had never taken any precautions for\r\n'b'defense, as dangerous animals had not shown themselves on that part of\r\n'b'the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, Pencroft and Neb were working in the poultry-yard, while\r\n'b'Harding and the reporter were occupied at the Chimneys in making soda,\r\n'b'the store of soap being exhausted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Suddenly cries resounded,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHelp! help!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and the reporter, being at too great a distance, had not\r\n'b'been able to hear the shouts. Pencroft and Neb, leaving the poultry-yard\r\n'b'in all haste, rushed towards the lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But before then, the stranger, whose presence at this place no one had\r\n'b'suspected, crossed Creek Glycerine, which separated the plateau from the\r\n'b'forest, and bounded up the opposite bank.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert was there face to face with a fierce jaguar, similar to the\r\n'b'one which had been killed on Reptile End. Suddenly surprised, he was\r\n'b'standing with his back against a tree, while the animal gathering itself\r\n'b'together was about to spring.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the stranger, with no other weapon than a knife, rushed on the\r\n'b'formidable animal, who turned to meet this new adversary.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The struggle was short. The stranger possessed immense strength and\r\n'b'activity. He seized the jaguar\xe2\x80\x99s throat with one powerful hand, holding\r\n'b'it as in a vise, without heeding the beast\xe2\x80\x99s claws which tore his flesh,\r\n'b'and with the other he plunged his knife into its heart.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The jaguar fell. The stranger kicked away the body, and was about to\r\n'b'fly at the moment when the settlers arrived on the field of battle, but\r\n'b'Herbert, clinging to him, cried,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! you shall not go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding advanced towards the stranger, who frowned when he saw him\r\n'b'approaching. The blood flowed from his shoulder under his torn shirt,\r\n'b'but he took no notice of it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have just contracted a debt of\r\n'b'gratitude to you. To save our boy you have risked your life!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy life!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured the stranger. \xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that worth? Less than\r\n'b'nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is no matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWill you give me your hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And as Herbert endeavored to seize the hand which had just saved him,\r\n'b'the stranger folded his arms, his chest heaved, his look darkened, and\r\n'b'he appeared to wish to escape, but making a violent effort over himself,\r\n'b'and in an abrupt tone,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho are you?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cand what do you claim to be to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 history which he thus demanded, and for the first\r\n'b'time. Perhaps this history recounted, he would tell his own.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few words Harding related all that had happened since their\r\n'b'departure from Richmond; how they had managed, and what resources they\r\n'b'now had at their disposal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger listened with extreme attention.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then the engineer told who they all were, Gideon Spilett, Herbert,\r\n'b'Pencroft, Neb, himself, and, he added, that the greatest happiness they\r\n'b'had felt since their arrival in Lincoln Island was on the return of the\r\n'b'vessel from Tabor Island, when they had been able to include among them\r\n'b'a new companion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At these words the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s face flushed, his head sunk on his breast,\r\n'b'and confusion was depicted on his countenance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now that you know us,\xe2\x80\x9d added Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwill you give us your\r\n'b'hand?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger in a hoarse voice; \xe2\x80\x9cno! You are honest men!\r\n'b'And I--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 17\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These last words justified the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 presentiment. There had been\r\n'b'some mournful past, perhaps expiated in the sight of men, but from which\r\n'b'his conscience had not yet absolved him. At any rate the guilty man felt\r\n'b'remorse, he repented, and his new friends would have cordially pressed\r\n'b'the hand which they sought; but he did not feel himself worthy to extend\r\n'b'it to honest men! However, after the scene with the jaguar, he did not\r\n'b'return to the forest, and from that day did not go beyond the enclosure\r\n'b'of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What was the mystery of his life? Would the stranger one day speak of\r\n'b'it? Time alone could show. At any rate, it was agreed that his secret\r\n'b'should never be asked from him, and that they would live with him as if\r\n'b'they suspected nothing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For some days their life continued as before. Cyrus Harding and Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett worked together, sometimes chemists, sometimes experimentalists.\r\n'b'The reporter never left the engineer except to hunt with Herbert, for\r\n'b'it would not have been prudent to allow the lad to ramble alone in the\r\n'b'forest; and it was very necessary to be on their guard. As to Neb\r\n'b'and Pencroft, one day at the stables and poultry-yard, another at the\r\n'b'corral, without reckoning work in Granite House, they were never in want\r\n'b'of employment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger worked alone, and he had resumed his usual life, never\r\n'b'appearing at meals, sleeping under the trees in the plateau, never\r\n'b'mingling with his companions. It really seemed as if the society of\r\n'b'those who had saved him was insupportable to him!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut then,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy did he entreat the help of his\r\n'b'fellow-creatures? Why did he throw that paper into the sea?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe will tell us why,\xe2\x80\x9d invariably replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps sooner than you think, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, indeed, the day of confession was near.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 10th of December, a week after his return to Granite House,\r\n'b'Harding saw the stranger approaching, who, in a calm voice and humble\r\n'b'tone, said to him: \xe2\x80\x9cSir, I have a request to make of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cbut first let me ask you a question.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At these words the stranger reddened, and was on the point of\r\n'b'withdrawing. Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in the mind of\r\n'b'the guilty man, who doubtless feared that the engineer would interrogate\r\n'b'him on his past life.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding held him back.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cComrade,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are not only your companions but your friends. I\r\n'b'wish you to believe that, and now I will listen to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger pressed his hand over his eyes. He was seized with a\r\n'b'sort of trembling, and remained a few moments without being able to\r\n'b'articulate a word.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he at last, \xe2\x80\x9cI have come to beg you to grant me a favor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, four or five miles from here, a corral for your domesticated\r\n'b'animals. These animals need to be taken care of. Will you allow me to\r\n'b'live there with them?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding gazed at the unfortunate man for a few moments with a\r\n'b'feeling of deep commiseration; then,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cthe corral has only stables hardly fit for\r\n'b'animals.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be good enough for me, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will not constrain you in anything.\r\n'b'You wish to live at the corral, so be it. You will, however, be always\r\n'b'welcome at Granite House. But since you wish to live at the corral\r\n'b'we will make the necessary arrangements for your being comfortably\r\n'b'established there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind that, I shall do very well.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friend,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding, who always intentionally made use of this\r\n'b'cordial appellation, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must let us judge what it will be best to do\r\n'b'in this respect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThank you, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the stranger as he withdrew.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer then made known to his companions the proposal which had\r\n'b'been made to him, and it was agreed that they should build a wooden\r\n'b'house at the corral, which they would make as comfortable as possible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That very day the colonists repaired to the corral with the necessary\r\n'b'tools, and a week had not passed before the house was ready to receive\r\n'b'its tenant. It was built about twenty feet from the sheds, and from\r\n'b'there it was easy to overlook the flock of sheep, which then numbered\r\n'b'more than eighty. Some furniture, a bed, table, bench, cupboard, and\r\n'b'chest were manufactured, and a gun, ammunition, and tools were carried\r\n'b'to the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger, however, had seen nothing of his new dwelling, and he\r\n'b'had allowed the settlers to work there without him, while he occupied\r\n'b'himself on the plateau, wishing, doubtless, to put the finishing stroke\r\n'b'to his work. Indeed, thanks to him, all the ground was dug up and ready\r\n'b'to be sowed when the time came.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was on the 20th of December that all the arrangements at the corral\r\n'b'were completed. The engineer announced to the stranger that his dwelling\r\n'b'was ready to receive him, and the latter replied that he would go and\r\n'b'sleep there that very evening.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this evening the colonists were gathered in the diningroom of Granite\r\n'b'House. It was then eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, the hour at which their companion was\r\n'b'to leave them. Not wishing to trouble him by their presence, and thus\r\n'b'imposing on him the necessity of saying farewells which might perhaps be\r\n'b'painful to him, they had left him alone and ascended to Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now, they had been talking in the room for a few minutes, when a light\r\n'b'knock was heard at the door. Almost immediately the stranger entered,\r\n'b'and without any preamble,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbefore I leave you, it is right that you should\r\n'b'know my history. I will tell it you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These simple words profoundly impressed Cyrus Harding and his\r\n'b'companions. The engineer rose.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe ask you nothing, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he; \xe2\x80\x9cit is your right to be\r\n'b'silent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is my duty to speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSit down, then.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, I will stand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are ready to hear you,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stranger remained standing in a corner of the room, a little in the\r\n'b'shade. He was bareheaded, his arms folded across his chest, and it\r\n'b'was in this posture that in a hoarse voice, speaking like some one\r\n'b'who obliges himself to speak, he gave the following recital, which his\r\n'b'auditors did not once interrupt:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn the 20th of December, 1854, a steam-yacht, belonging to a Scotch\r\n'b'nobleman, Lord Glenarvan, anchored off Cape Bernouilli, on the western\r\n'b'coast of Australia, in the thirty-seventh parallel. On board this yacht\r\n'b'were Lord Glenarvan and his wife, a major in the English army, a French\r\n'b'geographer, a young girl, and a young boy. These two last were the\r\n'b'children of Captain Grant, whose ship, the \xe2\x80\x98Britannia,\xe2\x80\x99 had been lost,\r\n'b'crew and cargo, a year before. The \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 was commanded by Captain\r\n'b'John Mangles, and manned by a crew of fifteen men.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is the reason the yacht at this time lay off the coast of\r\n'b'Australia. Six months before, a bottle, enclosing a document written in\r\n'b'English, German, and French, had been found in the Irish Sea, and picked\r\n'b'up by the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan.\xe2\x80\x99 This document stated in substance that there still\r\n'b'existed three survivors from the wreck of the \xe2\x80\x98Britannia,\xe2\x80\x99 that these\r\n'b'survivors were Captain Grant and two of his men, and that they had found\r\n'b'refuge on some land, of which the document gave the latitude, but of\r\n'b'which the longitude, effaced by the sea, was no longer legible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis latitude was 37deg 11\xe2\x80\x99 south; therefore, the longitude being\r\n'b'unknown, if they followed the thirty-seventh parallel over continents\r\n'b'and seas, they would be certain to reach the spot inhabited by Captain\r\n'b'Grant and his two companions. The English Admiralty having hesitated to\r\n'b'undertake this search, Lord Glenarvan resolved to attempt everything to\r\n'b'find the captain. He communicated with Mary and Robert Grant, who joined\r\n'b'him. The \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 yacht was equipped for the distant voyage, in which\r\n'b'the nobleman\xe2\x80\x99s family and the captain\xe2\x80\x99s children wished to take part,\r\n'b'and the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99 leaving Glasgow, proceeded towards the Atlantic,\r\n'b'passed through the Straits of Magellan, and ascended the Pacific as\r\n'b'far as Patagonia, where, according to a previous interpretation of the\r\n'b'document, they supposed that Captain Grant was a prisoner among the\r\n'b'Indians.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 disembarked her passengers on the western coast of\r\n'b'Patagonia, and sailed to pick them up again on the eastern coast at\r\n'b'Cape Corrientes. Lord Glenarvan traversed Patagonia, following the\r\n'b'thirty-seventh parallel, and having found no trace of the captain, he\r\n'b're-embarked on the 13th of November, so as to pursue his search through\r\n'b'the Ocean.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter having unsuccessfully visited the islands of Tristan d\xe2\x80\x99Acunha and\r\n'b'Amsterdam, situated in her course, the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99 as I have said, arrived\r\n'b'at Cape Bernouilli, on the Australian coast, on the 20th of December,\r\n'b'1854.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was Lord Glenarvan\xe2\x80\x99s intention to traverse Australia as he had\r\n'b'traversed America, and he disembarked. A few miles from the coast was\r\n'b'established a farm, belonging to an Irishman, who offered hospitality to\r\n'b'the travelers. Lord Glenarvan made known to the Irishman the cause\r\n'b'which had brought him to these parts, and asked if he knew whether a\r\n'b'three-masted English vessel, the \xe2\x80\x98Britannia,\xe2\x80\x99 had been lost less than\r\n'b'two years before on the west coast of Australia.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Irishman had never heard of this wreck, but, to the great surprise\r\n'b'of the bystanders, one of his servants came forward and said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98My lord, praise and thank God! If Captain Grant is still living, he is\r\n'b'living on the Australian shores.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Who are you?\xe2\x80\x99 asked Lord Glenarvan.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98A Scotchman like yourself, my lord,\xe2\x80\x99 replied the man; \xe2\x80\x98I am one of\r\n'b'Captain Grant\xe2\x80\x99s crew--one of the castaways of the \xe2\x80\x9cBritannia.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis man was called Ayrton. He was, in fact, the boatswain\xe2\x80\x99s mate of\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x98Britannia,\xe2\x80\x99 as his papers showed. But, separated from Captain Grant\r\n'b'at the moment when the ship struck upon the rocks, he had till then\r\n'b'believed that the captain with all his crew had perished, and that he,\r\n'b'Ayrton, was the sole survivor of the \xe2\x80\x98Britannia.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Only,\xe2\x80\x99 he added, \xe2\x80\x98it was not on the west coast, but on the east coast\r\n'b'of Australia that the vessel was lost, and if Captain Grant is still\r\n'b'living, as his document indicates, he is a prisoner among the natives,\r\n'b'and it is on the other coast that he must be looked for.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis man spoke in a frank voice and with a confident look; his words\r\n'b'could not be doubted. The Irishman, in whose service he had been for\r\n'b'more than a year, answered for his trustworthiness. Lord Glenarvan,\r\n'b'therefore, believed in the fidelity of this man and, by his advice,\r\n'b'resolved to cross Australia, following the thirty-seventh parallel. Lord\r\n'b'Glenarvan, his wife, the two children, the major, the Frenchman, Captain\r\n'b'Mangles, and a few sailors composed the little band under the command\r\n'b'of Ayrton, while the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99 under charge of the mate, Tom Austin,\r\n'b'proceeded to Melbourne, there to await Lord Glenarvan\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey set out on the 23rd of December, 1854.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is time to say that Ayrton was a traitor. He was, indeed, the\r\n'b'boatswain\xe2\x80\x99s mate of the \xe2\x80\x98Britannia,\xe2\x80\x99 but, after some dispute with his\r\n'b'captain, he endeavored to incite the crew to mutiny and seize the ship,\r\n'b'and Captain Grant had landed him, on the 8th of April, 1852, on the\r\n'b'west coast of Australia, and then sailed, leaving him there, as was only\r\n'b'just.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore this wretched man knew nothing of the wreck of the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Britannia\xe2\x80\x99; he had just heard of it from Glenarvan\xe2\x80\x99s account. Since his\r\n'b'abandonment, he had become, under the name of Ben Joyce, the leader of\r\n'b'the escaped convicts; and if he boldly maintained that the wreck had\r\n'b'taken place on the east coast, and led Lord Glenarvan to proceed in that\r\n'b'direction, it was that he hoped to separate him from his ship, seize the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99 and make the yacht a pirate in the Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Here the stranger stopped for a moment. His voice trembled, but he\r\n'b'continued,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe expedition set out and proceeded across Australia. It was\r\n'b'inevitably unfortunate, since Ayrton, or Ben Joyce, as he may be\r\n'b'called, guided it, sometimes preceded, sometimes followed by his band of\r\n'b'convicts, who had been told what they had to do.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMeanwhile, the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 had been sent to Melbourne for repairs. It was\r\n'b'necessary, then, to get Lord Glenarvan to order her to leave Melbourne\r\n'b'and go to the east coast of Australia, where it would be easy to seize\r\n'b'her. After having led the expedition near enough to the coast, in the\r\n'b'midst of vast forests with no resources, Ayrton obtained a letter, which\r\n'b'he was charged to carry to the mate of the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99--a letter which\r\n'b'ordered the yacht to repair immediately to the east coast, to Twofold\r\n'b'Bay, that is to say a few days\xe2\x80\x99 journey from the place where the\r\n'b'expedition had stopped. It was there that Ayrton had agreed to meet his\r\n'b'accomplices, and two days after gaining possession of the letter, he\r\n'b'arrived at Melbourne.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo far the villain had succeeded in his wicked design. He would be able\r\n'b'to take the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 into Twofold Bay, where it would be easy for the\r\n'b'convicts to seize her, and her crew massacred, Ben Joyce would become\r\n'b'master of the seas. But it pleased God to prevent the accomplishment of\r\n'b'these terrible projects.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton, arrived at Melbourne, delivered the letter to the mate, Tom\r\n'b'Austin, who read it and immediately set sail, but judge of Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s rage\r\n'b'and disappointment, when the next day he found that the mate was taking\r\n'b'the vessel, not to the east coast of Australia, to Twofold Bay, but to\r\n'b'the east coast of New Zealand. He wished to stop him, but Austin showed\r\n'b'him the letter!... And indeed, by a providential error of the French\r\n'b'geographer, who had written the letter, the east coast of New Zealand\r\n'b'was mentioned as the place of destination.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s plans were frustrated! He became outrageous. They put him\r\n'b'in irons. He was then taken to the coast of New Zealand, not knowing\r\n'b'what would become of his accomplices, or what would become of Lord\r\n'b'Glenarvan.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 cruised about on this coast until the 3rd of March. On\r\n'b'that day Ayrton heard the report of guns. The guns on the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 were\r\n'b'being fired, and soon Lord Glenarvan and his companions came on board.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what had happened.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter a thousand hardships, a thousand dangers, Lord Glenarvan had\r\n'b'accomplished his journey, and arrived on the east coast of Australia, at\r\n'b'Twofold Bay. \xe2\x80\x98No \xe2\x80\x9cDuncan!\xe2\x80\x9d\xe2\x80\x99 He telegraphed to Melbourne. They answered,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDuncan\xe2\x80\x9d sailed on the 18th instant. Destination unknown.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLord Glenarvan could only arrive at one conclusion; that his honest\r\n'b'yacht had fallen into the hands of Ben Joyce, and had become a pirate\r\n'b'vessel!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever, Lord Glenarvan would not give up. He was a bold and generous\r\n'b'man. He embarked in a merchant vessel, sailed to the west coast of New\r\n'b'Zealand, traversed it along the thirty-seventh parallel, without\r\n'b'finding any trace of Captain Grant; but on the other side, to his\r\n'b'great surprise, and by the will of Heaven, he found the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99 under\r\n'b'command of the mate, who had been waiting for him for five weeks!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis was on the 3rd of March, 1855. Lord Glenarvan was now on board the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99 but Ayrton was there also. He appeared before the nobleman,\r\n'b'who wished to extract from him all that the villain knew about Captain\r\n'b'Grant. Ayrton refused to speak. Lord Glenarvan then told him, that at\r\n'b'the first port they put into, he would be delivered up to the English\r\n'b'authorities. Ayrton remained mute.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 continued her voyage along the thirty-seventh parallel.\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, Lady Glenarvan undertook to vanquish the resistance of\r\n'b'the ruffian.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt last, her influence prevailed, and Ayrton, in exchange for what he\r\n'b'could tell, proposed that Lord Glenarvan should leave him on some island\r\n'b'in the Pacific, instead of giving him up to the English authorities.\r\n'b'Lord Glenarvan, resolving to do anything to obtain information about\r\n'b'Captain Grant, consented.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton then related all his life, and it was certain that he knew\r\n'b'nothing from the day on which Captain Grant had landed him on the\r\n'b'Australian coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, Lord Glenarvan kept the promise which he had given. The\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 continued her voyage and arrived at Tabor Island. It was there\r\n'b'that Ayrton was to be landed, and it was there also that, by a\r\n'b'veritable miracle, they found Captain Grant and two men, exactly on the\r\n'b'thirty-seventh parallel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe convict, then, went to take their place on this desert islet, and\r\n'b'at the moment he left the yacht these words were pronounced by Lord\r\n'b'Glenarvan:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Here, Ayrton, you will be far from any land, and without any possible\r\n'b'communication with your fellow-creatures. You cannot escape from this\r\n'b'islet on which the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 leaves you. You will be alone, under the eye\r\n'b'of a God who reads the depths of the heart, but you will be neither\r\n'b'lost nor forgotten, as was Captain Grant. Unworthy as you are to be\r\n'b'remembered by men, men will remember you. I know where you are Ayrton,\r\n'b'and I know where to find you. I will never forget it!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99 making sail, soon disappeared. This was 18th of\r\n'b'March, 1855.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'     (The events which have just been briefly related are taken\r\n'b'     from a work which some of our readers have no doubt read,\r\n'b'     and which is entitled, \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Grant\xe2\x80\x99s children.\xe2\x80\x9d They will\r\n'b'     remark on this occasion, as well as later, some discrepancy\r\n'b'     in the dates; but later again, they will understand why the\r\n'b'     real dates were not at first given.)\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton was alone, but he had no want of either ammunition, weapons,\r\n'b'tools, or seeds.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt his, the convict\xe2\x80\x99s disposal, was the house built by honest Captain\r\n'b'Grant. He had only to live and expiate in solitude the crimes which he\r\n'b'had committed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen, he repented, he was ashamed of his crimes and was very\r\n'b'miserable! He said to himself, that if men came some day to take\r\n'b'him from that islet, he must be worthy to return among them! How he\r\n'b'suffered, that wretched man! How he labored to recover himself by work!\r\n'b'How he prayed to be reformed by prayer! For two years, three years, this\r\n'b'went on, but Ayrton, humbled by solitude, always looking for some ship\r\n'b'to appear on the horizon, asking himself if the time of expiation would\r\n'b'soon be complete, suffered as none other suffered! Oh! how dreadful was\r\n'b'this solitude, to a heart tormented by remorse!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut doubtless Heaven had not sufficiently punished this unhappy man,\r\n'b'for he felt that he was gradually becoming a savage! He felt that\r\n'b'brutishness was gradually gaining on him!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe could not say if it was after two or three years of solitude, but at\r\n'b'last he became the miserable creature you found!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have no need to tell you, gentlemen, that Ayrton, Ben Joyce, and I,\r\n'b'are the same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions rose at the end of this account. It\r\n'b'is impossible to say how much they were moved! What misery, grief, and\r\n'b'despair lay revealed before them!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding, rising, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have been a great criminal, but\r\n'b'Heaven must certainly think that you have expiated your crimes! That\r\n'b'has been proved by your having been brought again among your\r\n'b'fellow-creatures. Ayrton, you are forgiven! And now you will be our\r\n'b'companion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton drew back.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere is my hand!\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton grasped the hand which Harding extended to him, and great tears\r\n'b'fell from his eyes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWill you live with us?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding, leave me some time longer,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ayrton, \xe2\x80\x9cleave me\r\n'b'alone in the hut in the corral!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs you like, Ayrton,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding. Ayrton was going to\r\n'b'withdraw, when the engineer addressed one more question to him:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne word more, my friend. Since it was your intention to live alone,\r\n'b'why did you throw into the sea the document which put us on your track?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA document?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Ayrton, who did not appear to know what he meant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, the document which we found enclosed in a bottle, giving us the\r\n'b'exact position of Tabor Island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton passed his hand over his brow, then after having thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n'b'never threw any document into the sea!\xe2\x80\x9d he answered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever?\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Ayrton, bowing, reached the door and departed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 18\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPoor man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, who had rushed to the door, but returned,\r\n'b'having seen Ayrton slide down the rope on the lift and disappear in the\r\n'b'darkness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe will come back,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome, now, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat does that mean? What!\r\n'b'wasn\xe2\x80\x99t it Ayrton who threw that bottle into the sea? Who was it then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Certainly, if ever a question was necessary to be made, it was that one!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was he,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Neb, \xe2\x80\x9conly the unhappy man was half-mad.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand he was no longer conscious of what he was\r\n'b'doing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt can only be explained in that way, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding\r\n'b'quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cand I understand now how Ayrton was able to point out exactly\r\n'b'the situation of Tabor Island, since the events which had preceded his\r\n'b'being left on the island had made it known to him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cif he was not yet a brute when he wrote\r\n'b'that document, and if he threw it into the sea seven or eight years ago,\r\n'b'how is it that the paper has not been injured by damp?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat proves,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Ayrton was deprived of\r\n'b'intelligence at a more recent time than he thinks.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course it must be so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwithout that the fact\r\n'b'would be unaccountable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnaccountable indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, who did not appear\r\n'b'desirous to prolong the conversation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut has Ayrton told the truth?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe story which he has told is true in\r\n'b'every point. I remember quite well the account in the newspapers of the\r\n'b'yacht expedition undertaken by Lord Glenarvan, and its result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton has told the truth,\xe2\x80\x9d added Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cDo not doubt it, Pencroft,\r\n'b'for it was painful to him. People tell the truth when they accuse\r\n'b'themselves like that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day--the 21st of December--the colonists descended to the\r\n'b'beach, and having climbed the plateau they found nothing of Ayrton. He\r\n'b'had reached his house in the corral during the night and the settlers\r\n'b'judged it best not to agitate him by their presence. Time would\r\n'b'doubtless perform what sympathy had been unable to accomplish.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert, Pencroft, and Neb resumed their ordinary occupations. On this\r\n'b'day the same work brought Harding and the reporter to the workshop at\r\n'b'the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, my dear Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the explanation\r\n'b'you gave yesterday on the subject of the bottle has not satisfied me at\r\n'b'all! How can it be supposed that the unfortunate man was able to write\r\n'b'that document and throw the bottle into the sea without having the\r\n'b'slightest recollection of it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNor was it he who threw it in, my dear Spilett.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou think then--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think nothing, I know nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cI am\r\n'b'content to rank this incident among those which I have not been able to\r\n'b'explain to this day!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed, Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthese things are incredible! Your\r\n'b'rescue, the case stranded on the sand, Top\xe2\x80\x99s adventure, and lastly this\r\n'b'bottle... Shall we never have the answer to these enigmas?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer quickly, \xe2\x80\x9cyes, even if I have to penetrate\r\n'b'into the bowels of this island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cChance will perhaps give us the key to this mystery!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cChance! Spilett! I do not believe in chance, any more than I believe in\r\n'b'mysteries in this world. There is a reason for everything unaccountable\r\n'b'which has happened here, and that reason I shall discover. But in the\r\n'b'meantime we must work and observe.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The month of January arrived. The year 1867 commenced. The summer\r\n'b'occupations were assiduously continued. During the days which followed,\r\n'b'Herbert and Spilett having gone in the direction of the corral,\r\n'b'ascertained that Ayrton had taken possession of the habitation which\r\n'b'had been prepared for him. He busied himself with the numerous flock\r\n'b'confided to his care, and spared his companions the trouble of coming\r\n'b'every two or three days to visit the corral. Nevertheless, in order not\r\n'b'to leave Ayrton in solitude for too long a time, the settlers often paid\r\n'b'him a visit.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was not unimportant either, in consequence of some suspicions\r\n'b'entertained by the engineer and Gideon Spilett, that this part of\r\n'b'the island should be subject to a surveillance of some sort, and that\r\n'b'Ayrton, if any incident occurred unexpectedly, should not neglect to\r\n'b'inform the inhabitants of Granite House of it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nevertheless it might happen that something would occur which it would\r\n'b'be necessary to bring rapidly to the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s knowledge. Independently\r\n'b'of facts bearing on the mystery of Lincoln Island, many others\r\n'b'might happen, which would call for the prompt interference of the\r\n'b'colonists,--such as the sighting of a vessel, a wreck on the western\r\n'b'coast, the possible arrival of pirates, etc.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Therefore Cyrus Harding resolved to put the corral in instantaneous\r\n'b'communication with Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was on the 10th of January that he made known his project to his\r\n'b'companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy! how are you going to manage that, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cDo\r\n'b'you by chance happen to think of establishing a telegraph?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cExactly so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cElectric?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cElectric,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have all the necessary materials\r\n'b'for making a battery, and the most difficult thing will be to stretch\r\n'b'the wires, but by means of a drawplate I think we shall manage it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, after that,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall never despair of\r\n'b'seeing ourselves some day rolling along on a railway!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They then set to work, beginning with the most difficult thing, for, if\r\n'b'they failed in that, it would be useless to manufacture the battery and\r\n'b'other accessories.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The iron of Lincoln Island, as has been said, was of excellent quality,\r\n'b'and consequently very fit for being drawn out. Harding commenced by\r\n'b'manufacturing a drawplate, that is to say, a plate of steel, pierced\r\n'b'with conical holes of different sizes, which would successively bring\r\n'b'the wire to the wished-for tenacity. This piece of steel, after having\r\n'b'been tempered, was fixed in as firm a way as possible in a solid\r\n'b'framework planted in the ground, only a few feet from the great fall,\r\n'b'the motive power of which the engineer intended to utilize. In fact as\r\n'b'the fulling-mill was there, although not then in use, its beam moved\r\n'b'with extreme power would serve to stretch out the wire by rolling it\r\n'b'round itself. It was a delicate operation, and required much care. The\r\n'b'iron, prepared previously in long thin rods, the ends of which were\r\n'b'sharpened with the file, having been introduced into the largest hole of\r\n'b'the drawplate, was drawn out by the beam which wound it round itself,\r\n'b'to a length of twenty-five or thirty feet, then unrolled, and the same\r\n'b'operation was performed successively through the holes of a less size.\r\n'b'Finally, the engineer obtained wires from forty to fifty feet long,\r\n'b'which could be easily fastened together and stretched over the distance\r\n'b'of five miles, which separated the corral from the bounds of Granite\r\n'b'House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It did not take more than a few days to perform this work, and indeed\r\n'b'as soon as the machine had been commenced, Cyrus Harding left his\r\n'b'companions to follow the trade of wiredrawers, and occupied himself with\r\n'b'manufacturing his battery.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was necessary to obtain a battery with a constant current. It is\r\n'b'known that the elements of modern batteries are generally composed of\r\n'b'retort coal, zinc, and copper. Copper was absolutely wanting to the\r\n'b'engineer, who, notwithstanding all his researches, had never been able\r\n'b'to find any trace of it in Lincoln Island, and was therefore obliged to\r\n'b'do without it. Retort coal, that is to say, the hard graphite which\r\n'b'is found in the retorts of gas manufactories, after the coal has\r\n'b'been dehydrogenized, could have been obtained, but it would have been\r\n'b'necessary to establish a special apparatus, involving great labor. As\r\n'b'to zinc, it may be remembered that the case found at Flotsam Point was\r\n'b'lined with this metal, which could not be better utilized than for this\r\n'b'purpose.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, after mature consideration, decided to manufacture a\r\n'b'very simple battery, resembling as nearly as possible that invented\r\n'b'by Becquerel in 1820, and in which zinc only is employed. The other\r\n'b'substances, azotic acid and potash, were all at his disposal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The way in which the battery was composed was as follows, and the\r\n'b'results were to be attained by the reaction of acid and potash on each\r\n'b'other. A number of glass bottles were made and filled with azotic acid.\r\n'b'The engineer corked them by means of a stopper through which passed a\r\n'b'glass tube, bored at its lower extremity, and intended to be plunged\r\n'b'into the acid by means of a clay stopper secured by a rag. Into this\r\n'b'tube, through its upper extremity, he poured a solution of potash,\r\n'b'previously obtained by burning and reducing to ashes various plants,\r\n'b'and in this way the acid and potash could act on each other through the\r\n'b'clay.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding then took two slips of zinc, one of which was plunged\r\n'b'into azotic acid, the other into a solution of potash. A current was\r\n'b'immediately produced, which was transmitted from the slip of zinc in the\r\n'b'bottle to that in the tube, and the two slips having been connected by a\r\n'b'metallic wire the slip in the tube became the positive pole, and that in\r\n'b'the bottle the negative pole of the apparatus. Each bottle, therefore,\r\n'b'produced as many currents as united would be sufficient to produce all\r\n'b'the phenomena of the electric telegraph. Such was the ingenious and very\r\n'b'simple apparatus constructed by Cyrus Harding, an apparatus which would\r\n'b'allow them to establish a telegraphic communication between Granite\r\n'b'House and the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 6th of February was commenced the planting along the road to\r\n'b'the corral, of posts furnished with glass insulators, and intended to\r\n'b'support the wire. A few days after, the wire was extended, ready to\r\n'b'produce the electric current at a rate of twenty thousand miles a\r\n'b'second.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two batteries had been manufactured, one for Granite House, the other\r\n'b'for the corral; for if it was necessary the corral should be able to\r\n'b'communicate with Granite House it might also be useful that Granite\r\n'b'House should be able to communicate with the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the receiver and manipulator, they were very simple. At the two\r\n'b'stations the wire was wound round a magnet, that is to say, round a\r\n'b'piece of soft iron surrounded with a wire. The communication was thus\r\n'b'established between the two poles; the current, starting from the\r\n'b'positive pole, traversed the wire, passed through the magnet which was\r\n'b'temporarily magnetized, and returned through the earth to the negative\r\n'b'pole. If the current was interrupted, the magnet immediately became\r\n'b'unmagnetized. It was sufficient to place a plate of soft iron before the\r\n'b'magnet, which, attracted during the passage of the current, would fall\r\n'b'back when the current was interrupted. This movement of the plate thus\r\n'b'obtained, Harding could easily fasten to it a needle arranged on a dial,\r\n'b'bearing the letters of the alphabet, and in this way communicate from\r\n'b'one station to the other.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All was completely arranged by the 12th of February. On this day,\r\n'b'Harding, having sent the current through the wire, asked if all\r\n'b'was going on well at the corral, and received in a few moments a\r\n'b'satisfactory reply from Ayrton. Pencroft was wild with joy, and every\r\n'b'morning and evening he sent a telegram to the corral, which always\r\n'b'received an answer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This mode of communication presented two very real advantages: firstly,\r\n'b'because it enabled them to ascertain that Ayrton was at the corral; and\r\n'b'secondly, that he was thus not left completely isolated. Besides, Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding never allowed a week to pass without going to see him, and\r\n'b'Ayrton came from time to time to Granite House, where he always found a\r\n'b'cordial welcome.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The fine season passed away in the midst of the usual work. The\r\n'b'resources of the colony, particularly in vegetables and corn, increased\r\n'b'from day to day, and the plants brought from Tabor Island had succeeded\r\n'b'perfectly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The plateau of Prospect Heights presented an encouraging aspect. The\r\n'b'fourth harvest had been admirable and it may be supposed that no one\r\n'b'thought of counting whether the four hundred thousand millions of grains\r\n'b'duly appeared in the crop. However, Pencroft had thought of doing so,\r\n'b'but Cyrus Harding having told him that even if he managed to count three\r\n'b'hundred grains a minute, or nine thousand an hour, it would take him\r\n'b'nearly five thousand five-hundred years to finish his task, the honest\r\n'b'sailor considered it best to give up the idea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The weather was splendid, the temperature very warm in the day time, but\r\n'b'in the evening the sea-breezes tempered the heat of the atmosphere and\r\n'b'procured cool nights for the inhabitants of Granite House. There were,\r\n'b'however, a few storms, which, although they were not of long duration,\r\n'b'swept over Lincoln Island with extraordinary fury. The lightning blazed\r\n'b'and the thunder continued to roll for some hours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this period the little colony was extremely prosperous.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The tenants of the poultry-yard swarmed, and they lived on the surplus,\r\n'b'but it became necessary to reduce the population to a more moderate\r\n'b'number. The pigs had already produced young, and it may be understood\r\n'b'that their care for these animals absorbed a great part of Neb and\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s time. The onagers, who had two pretty colts, were most often\r\n'b'mounted by Gideon Spilett and Herbert, who had become an excellent rider\r\n'b'under the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s instruction, and they also harnessed them to the\r\n'b'cart either for carrying wood and coal to Granite House, or different\r\n'b'mineral productions required by the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Several expeditions were made about this time into the depths of the Far\r\n'b'West Forests. The explorers could venture there without having anything\r\n'b'to fear from the heat, for the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays scarcely penetrated through\r\n'b'the thick foliage spreading above their heads. They thus visited all the\r\n'b'left bank of the Mercy, along which ran the road from the corral to the\r\n'b'mouth of Falls River.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But in these excursions the settlers took care to be well armed, for\r\n'b'they met with savage wild boars, with which they often had a tussle.\r\n'b'They also, during this season, made fierce war against the jaguars.\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett had vowed a special hatred against them, and his pupil\r\n'b'Herbert seconded him well. Armed as they were, they no longer feared\r\n'b'to meet one of those beasts. Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s courage was superb, and the\r\n'b'reporter\xe2\x80\x99s sang-froid astonishing. Already twenty magnificent skins\r\n'b'ornamented the dining-room of Granite House, and if this continued, the\r\n'b'jaguar race would soon be extinct in the island, the object aimed at by\r\n'b'the hunters.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer sometimes took part in the expeditions made to the unknown\r\n'b'parts of the island, which he surveyed with great attention. It was for\r\n'b'other traces than those of animals that he searched the thickets of the\r\n'b'vast forest, but nothing suspicious ever appeared. Neither Top nor Jup,\r\n'b'who accompanied him, ever betrayed by their behavior that there was\r\n'b'anything strange there, and yet more than once again the dog barked at\r\n'b'the mouth of the well, which the engineer had before explored without\r\n'b'result.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this time Gideon Spilett, aided by Herbert, took several views of\r\n'b'the most picturesque parts of the island, by means of the photographic\r\n'b'apparatus found in the cases, and of which they had not as yet made any\r\n'b'use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This apparatus, provided with a powerful object-glass, was very\r\n'b'complete. Substances necessary for the photographic reproduction,\r\n'b'collodion for preparing the glass plate, nitrate of silver to render it\r\n'b'sensitive, hyposulfate of soda to fix the prints obtained, chloride of\r\n'b'ammonium in which to soak the paper destined to give the positive proof,\r\n'b'acetate of soda and chloride of gold in which to immerse the paper,\r\n'b'nothing was wanting. Even the papers were there, all prepared,\r\n'b'and before laying in the printing-frame upon the negatives, it was\r\n'b'sufficient to soak them for a few minutes in the solution of nitrate of\r\n'b'silver.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter and his assistant became in a short time very skilful\r\n'b'operators, and they obtained fine views of the country, such as the\r\n'b'island, taken from Prospect Heights with Mount Franklin in the distance,\r\n'b'the mouth of the Mercy, so picturesquely framed in high rocks, the glade\r\n'b'and the corral, with the spurs of the mountain in the background, the\r\n'b'curious development of Claw Cape, Flotsam Point, etc.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nor did the photographers forget to take the portraits of all the\r\n'b'inhabitants of the island, leaving out no one.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt multiplies us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor was enchanted to see his own countenance, faithfully\r\n'b'reproduced, ornamenting the walls of Granite House, and he stopped\r\n'b'as willingly before this exhibition as he would have done before the\r\n'b'richest shop-windows in Broadway.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But it must be acknowledged that the most successful portrait was\r\n'b'incontestably that of Master Jup. Master Jup had sat with a gravity not\r\n'b'to be described, and his portrait was lifelike!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe looks as if he was just going to grin!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And if Master Jup had not been satisfied, he would have been very\r\n'b'difficult to please; but he was quite contented and contemplated his own\r\n'b'countenance with a sentimental air which expressed some small amount of\r\n'b'conceit.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The summer heat ended with the month of March. The weather was sometimes\r\n'b'rainy, but still warm. The month of March, which corresponds to the\r\n'b'September of northern latitudes, was not so fine as might have been\r\n'b'hoped. Perhaps it announced an early and rigorous winter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It might have been supposed one morning--the 21 st--that the first snow\r\n'b'had already made its appearance. In fact Herbert looking early from one\r\n'b'of the windows of Granite House, exclaimed,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHallo! the islet is covered with snow!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSnow at this time?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, joining the boy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their companions were soon beside them, but could only ascertain one\r\n'b'thing, that not only the islet but all the beach below Granite House was\r\n'b'covered with one uniform sheet of white.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt must be snow!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOr rather it\xe2\x80\x99s very like it!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut the thermometer marks fifty-eight degrees!\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding gazed at the sheet of white without saying anything, for\r\n'b'he really did not know how to explain this phenomenon, at this time of\r\n'b'year and in such a temperature.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBy Jove!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9call our plants will be frozen!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor was about to descend, when he was preceded by the nimble\r\n'b'Jup, who slid down to the sand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the orang had not touched the ground, when the snowy sheet arose and\r\n'b'dispersed in the air in such innumerable flakes that the light of the\r\n'b'sun was obscured for some minutes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBirds!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were indeed swarms of sea-birds, with dazzling white plumage.\r\n'b'They had perched by thousands on the islet and on the shore, and they\r\n'b'disappeared in the distance, leaving the colonists amazed as if they\r\n'b'had been present at some transformation scene, in which summer succeeded\r\n'b'winter at the touch of a fairy\xe2\x80\x99s wand. Unfortunately the change had been\r\n'b'so sudden, that neither the reporter nor the lad had been able to bring\r\n'b'down one of these birds, of which they could not recognize the species.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few days after came the 26th of March, the day on which, two years\r\n'b'before, the castaways from the air had been thrown upon Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 19\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Two years already! and for two years the colonists had had no\r\n'b'communication with their fellow-creatures! They were without news from\r\n'b'the civilized world, lost on this island, as completely as if they had\r\n'b'been on the most minute star of the celestial hemisphere!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What was now happening in their country? The picture of their native\r\n'b'land was always before their eyes, the land torn by civil war at the\r\n'b'time they left it, and which the Southern rebellion was perhaps still\r\n'b'staining with blood! It was a great sorrow to them, and they often\r\n'b'talked together of these things, without ever doubting however that\r\n'b'the cause of the North must triumph, for the honor of the American\r\n'b'Confederation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During these two years not a vessel had passed in sight of the island;\r\n'b'or, at least, not a sail had been seen. It was evident that Lincoln\r\n'b'Island was out of the usual track, and also that it was unknown,--as was\r\n'b'besides proved by the maps,--for though there was no port, vessels might\r\n'b'have visited it for the purpose of renewing their store of water. But\r\n'b'the surrounding ocean was deserted as far as the eye could reach, and\r\n'b'the colonists must rely on themselves for regaining their native land.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, one chance of rescue existed, and this chance was discussed\r\n'b'one day on the first week of April, when the colonists were gathered\r\n'b'together in the dining-room of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had been talking of America, of their native country, which they\r\n'b'had so little hope of ever seeing again.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDecidedly we have only one way,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cone single way for\r\n'b'leaving Lincoln Island, and that is, to build a vessel large enough to\r\n'b'sail several hundred miles. It appears to me, that when one has built a\r\n'b'boat it is just as easy to build a ship!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in which we might go to the Pomoutous,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cjust as\r\n'b'easily as we went to Tabor Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do not say no,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, who had always the casting vote\r\n'b'in maritime questions; \xe2\x80\x9cI do not say no, although it is not exactly the\r\n'b'same thing to make a long as a short voyage! If our little craft had\r\n'b'been caught in any heavy gale of wind during the voyage to Tabor Island,\r\n'b'we should have known that land was at no great distance either way; but\r\n'b'twelve hundred miles is a pretty long way, and the nearest land is at\r\n'b'least that distance!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWould you not, in that case, Pencroft, attempt the adventure?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\n'b'the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will attempt anything that is desired, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\n'b'sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand you know well that I am not a man to flinch!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRemember, besides, that we number another sailor amongst us now,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' remarked Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf he will consent to come,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the reporter; \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think that if Lord\r\n'b'Glenarvan\xe2\x80\x99s yacht had appeared at Tabor Island, while he was still\r\n'b'living there, Ayrton would have refused to depart?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou forget, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d then said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cthat Ayrton was not\r\n'b'in possession of his reason during the last years of his stay there. But\r\n'b'that is not the question. The point is to know if we may count among\r\n'b'our chances of being rescued, the return of the Scotch vessel. Now,\r\n'b'Lord Glenarvan promised Ayrton that he would return to take him off from\r\n'b'Tabor Island when he considered that his crimes were expiated, and I\r\n'b'believe that he will return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand I will add that he will return soon, for\r\n'b'it is twelve years since Ayrton was abandoned.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI agree with you that the nobleman will\r\n'b'return, and soon too. But where will he touch? At Tabor Island, and not\r\n'b'at Lincoln Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is the more certain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cas Lincoln Island is not\r\n'b'even marked on the map.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTherefore, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe ought to take the\r\n'b'necessary precautions for making our presence and that of Ayrton on\r\n'b'Lincoln Island known at Tabor Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand nothing is easier than to place\r\n'b'in the hut, which was Captain Grant\xe2\x80\x99s and Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s dwelling, a notice\r\n'b'which Lord Glenarvan and his crew cannot help finding, giving the\r\n'b'position of our island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a pity,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat we forgot to take that\r\n'b'precaution on our first visit to Tabor Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why should we have done it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cAt that time we did\r\n'b'not know Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s history; we did not know that any one was likely to\r\n'b'come some day to fetch him, and when we did know his history, the season\r\n'b'was too advanced to allow us to return then to Tabor Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cit was too late, and we must put off the voyage\r\n'b'until next spring.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose the Scotch yacht comes before that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not probable,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cfor Lord Glenarvan would\r\n'b'not choose the winter season to venture into these seas. Either he has\r\n'b'already returned to Tabor Island, since Ayrton has been with us, that is\r\n'b'to say, during the last five months and has left again; or he will not\r\n'b'come till later, and it will be time enough in the first fine October\r\n'b'days to go to Tabor Island, and leave a notice there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must allow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it will be very unfortunate if the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 has returned to these parts only a few months ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hope that it is not so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand that Heaven has\r\n'b'not deprived us of the best chance which remains to us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d observed the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat at any rate we shall know what\r\n'b'we have to depend on when we have been to Tabor Island, for if the yacht\r\n'b'has returned there, they will necessarily have left some traces of their\r\n'b'visit.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is evident,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cSo then, my friends, since\r\n'b'we have this chance of returning to our country, we must wait patiently,\r\n'b'and if it is taken from us we shall see what will be best to do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cit is well understood that if we\r\n'b'do leave Lincoln Island, it will not be because we were uncomfortable\r\n'b'there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be because we are far\r\n'b'from all that a man holds dearest in the world, his family, his friends,\r\n'b'his native land!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Matters being thus decided, the building of a vessel large enough to\r\n'b'sail either to the Archipelagoes in the north, or to New Zealand in\r\n'b'the west, was no longer talked of, and they busied themselves in their\r\n'b'accustomed occupations, with a view to wintering a third time in Granite\r\n'b'House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, it was agreed that before the stormy weather came on, their\r\n'b'little vessel should be employed in making a voyage round the island.\r\n'b'A complete survey of the coast had not yet been made, and the colonists\r\n'b'had but an imperfect idea of the shore to the west and north, from the\r\n'b'mouth of Falls River to the Mandible Capes, as well as of the narrow bay\r\n'b'between them, which opened like a shark\xe2\x80\x99s jaws.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The plan of this excursion was proposed by Pencroft, and Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'fully acquiesced in it, for he himself wished to see this part of his\r\n'b'domain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The weather was variable, but the barometer did not fluctuate by sudden\r\n'b'movements, and they could therefore count on tolerable weather. However,\r\n'b'during the first week of April, after a sudden barometrical fall, a\r\n'b'renewed rise was marked by a heavy gale of wind, lasting five or six\r\n'b'days; then the needle of the instrument remained stationary at a\r\n'b'height of twenty-nine inches and nine-tenths, and the weather appeared\r\n'b'propitious for an excursion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The departure was fixed for the 16th of April, and the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' anchored in Port Balloon, was provisioned for a voyage which might be of\r\n'b'some duration.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding informed Ayrton of the projected expedition, and proposed\r\n'b'that he should take part in it, but Ayrton preferring to remain on\r\n'b'shore, it was decided that he should come to Granite House during the\r\n'b'absence of his companions. Master Jup was ordered to keep him company,\r\n'b'and made no remonstrance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the morning of the 16th of April all the colonists, including Top,\r\n'b'embarked. A fine breeze blew from the south-west, and the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' tacked on leaving Port Balloon so as to reach Reptile End. Of the ninety\r\n'b'miles which the perimeter of the island measured, twenty included the\r\n'b'south coast between the port and the promontory. The wind being right\r\n'b'ahead it was necessary to hug the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It took the whole day to reach the promontory, for the vessel on leaving\r\n'b'port had only two hours of ebb tide and had therefore to make way for\r\n'b'six hours against the flood. It was nightfall before the promontory was\r\n'b'doubled.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor then proposed to the engineer that they should continue\r\n'b'sailing slowly with two reefs in the sail. But Harding preferred to\r\n'b'anchor a few cable-lengths from the shore, so as to survey that part of\r\n'b'the coast during the day. It was agreed also that as they were anxious\r\n'b'for a minute exploration of the coast they should not sail during the\r\n'b'night, but would always, when the weather permitted it, be at anchor\r\n'b'near the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night was passed under the promontory, and the wind having fallen,\r\n'b'nothing disturbed the silence. The passengers, with the exception of the\r\n'b'sailor, scarcely slept as well on board the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d as they would\r\n'b'have done in their rooms at Granite House, but they did sleep however.\r\n'b'Pencroft set sail at break of day, and by going on the larboard tack\r\n'b'they could keep close to the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists knew this beautiful wooded coast, since they had already\r\n'b'explored it on foot, and yet it again excited their admiration. They\r\n'b'coasted along as close in as possible, so as to notice everything,\r\n'b'avoiding always the trunks of trees which floated here and there.\r\n'b'Several times also they anchored, and Gideon Spilett took photographs of\r\n'b'the superb scenery.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About noon the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d arrived at the mouth of Falls River.\r\n'b'Beyond, on the left bank, a few scattered trees appeared, and three\r\n'b'miles further even these dwindled into solitary groups among the western\r\n'b'spurs of the mountain, whose arid ridge sloped down to the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What a contrast between the northern and southern part of the coast!\r\n'b'In proportion as one was woody and fertile so was the other rugged and\r\n'b'barren! It might have been designated as one of those iron coasts, as\r\n'b'they are called in some countries, and its wild confusion appeared to\r\n'b'indicate that a sudden crystallization had been produced in the yet\r\n'b'liquid basalt of some distant geological sea. These stupendous masses\r\n'b'would have terrified the settlers if they had been cast at first on\r\n'b'this part of the island! They had not been able to perceive the sinister\r\n'b'aspect of this shore from the summit of Mount Franklin, for they\r\n'b'overlooked it from too great a height, but viewed from the sea it\r\n'b'presented a wild appearance which could not perhaps be equaled in any\r\n'b'corner of the globe.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d sailed along this coast for the distance of half a\r\n'b'mile. It was easy to see that it was composed of blocks of all sizes,\r\n'b'from twenty to three hundred feet in height, and of all shapes, round\r\n'b'like towers, prismatic like steeples, pyramidal like obelisks, conical\r\n'b'like factory chimneys. An iceberg of the Polar seas could not have been\r\n'b'more capricious in its terrible sublimity! Here, bridges were thrown\r\n'b'from one rock to another; there, arches like those of a wave, into the\r\n'b'depths of which the eye could not penetrate; in one place, large vaulted\r\n'b'excavations presented a monumental aspect; in another, a crowd of\r\n'b'columns, spires, and arches, such as no Gothic cathedral ever\r\n'b'possessed. Every caprice of nature, still more varied than those of the\r\n'b'imagination, appeared on this grand coast, which extended over a length\r\n'b'of eight or nine miles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions gazed, with a feeling of surprise\r\n'b'bordering on stupefaction. But, although they remained silent, Top,\r\n'b'not being troubled with feelings of this sort, uttered barks which were\r\n'b'repeated by the thousand echoes of the basaltic cliff. The engineer\r\n'b'even observed that these barks had something strange in them, like those\r\n'b'which the dog had uttered at the mouth of the well in Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go close in,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d sailed as near as possible to the rocky shore.\r\n'b'Perhaps some cave, which it would be advisable to explore, existed\r\n'b'there? But Harding saw nothing, not a cavern, not a cleft which could\r\n'b'serve as a retreat to any being whatever, for the foot of the cliff was\r\n'b'washed by the surf. Soon Top\xe2\x80\x99s barks ceased, and the vessel continued\r\n'b'her course at a few cables-length from the coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the northwest part of the island the shore became again flat and\r\n'b'sandy. A few trees here and there rose above a low, marshy ground, which\r\n'b'the colonists had already surveyed, and in violent contrast to the other\r\n'b'desert shore, life was again manifested by the presence of myriads of\r\n'b'water-fowl. That evening the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d anchored in a small bay\r\n'b'to the north of the island, near the land, such was the depth of water\r\n'b'there. The night passed quietly, for the breeze died away with the last\r\n'b'light of day, and only rose again with the first streaks of dawn.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As it was easy to land, the usual hunters of the colony, that is to say,\r\n'b'Herbert and Gideon Spilett, went for a ramble of two hours or so, and\r\n'b'returned with several strings of wild duck and snipe. Top had\r\n'b'done wonders, and not a bird had been lost, thanks to his zeal and\r\n'b'cleverness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d set sail, and ran\r\n'b'rapidly towards North Mandible Cape, for the wind was right astern and\r\n'b'freshening rapidly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI should not be surprised if a gale came\r\n'b'up from the west. Yesterday the sun set in a very red-looking horizon,\r\n'b'and now, this morning, those mares-tails don\xe2\x80\x99t forbode anything good.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These mares-tails are cirrus clouds, scattered in the zenith, their\r\n'b'height from the sea being less than five thousand feet. They look like\r\n'b'light pieces of cotton wool, and their presence usually announces some\r\n'b'sudden change in the weather.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding, \xe2\x80\x9clet us carry as much sail as possible, and run\r\n'b'for shelter into Shark Gulf. I think that the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 will be\r\n'b'safe there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerfectly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand besides, the north coast is merely\r\n'b'sand, very uninteresting to look at.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI shall not be sorry,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cto pass not only to-night\r\n'b'but to-morrow in that bay, which is worth being carefully explored.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think that we shall be obliged to do so, whether we like it or not,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the sky looks very threatening towards the west.\r\n'b'Dirty weather is coming on!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate we have a favorable wind for reaching Cape Mandible,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' observed the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA very fine wind,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut we must tack to enter the\r\n'b'gulf, and I should like to see my way clear in these unknown quarters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cQuarters which appear to be filled with rocks,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cif we\r\n'b'judge by what we saw on the south coast of Shark Gulf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cdo as you think best, we will leave it\r\n'b'to you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDon\xe2\x80\x99t make your mind uneasy, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall not\r\n'b'expose myself needlessly! I would rather a knife were run into my ribs\r\n'b'than a sharp rock into those of my \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That which Pencroft called ribs was the part of his vessel under water,\r\n'b'and he valued it more than his own skin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat o\xe2\x80\x99clock is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTen o\xe2\x80\x99clock,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what distance is it to the Cape, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAbout fifteen miles,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s a matter of two hours and a half,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand we\r\n'b'shall be off the Cape between twelve and one o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Unluckily, the\r\n'b'tide will be turning at that moment, and will be ebbing out of the gulf.\r\n'b'I am afraid that it will be very difficult to get in, having both wind\r\n'b'and tide against us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd the more so that it is a full moon to-day,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\n'b'these April tides are very strong.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding, \xe2\x80\x9ccan you not anchor off the Cape?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnchor near land, with bad weather coming on!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you thinking of, captain? We should run aground, of a\r\n'b'certainty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat will you do then?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI shall try to keep in the offing until the flood, that is to say, till\r\n'b'about seven in the evening, and if there is still light enough I will\r\n'b'try to enter the gulf; if not, we must stand off and on during the\r\n'b'night, and we will enter to-morrow at sunrise.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs I told you, Pencroft, we will leave it to you,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cif there was only a lighthouse on the coast, it\r\n'b'would be much more convenient for sailors.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand this time we shall have no obliging\r\n'b'engineer to light a fire to guide us into port!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, indeed, my dear Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have never thanked you;\r\n'b'but frankly, without that fire we should never have been able--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA fire?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding, much astonished at the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s words.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe mean, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat on board the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'we were very anxious during the few hours before our return, and we\r\n'b'should have passed to windward of the island, if it had not been for the\r\n'b'precaution you took of lighting a fire the night of the 19th of October,\r\n'b'on Prospect Heights.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! That was a lucky idea of mine!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd this time,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cunless the idea occurs to\r\n'b'Ayrton, there will be no one to do us that little service!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo! No one!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few minutes after, finding himself alone in the bows of the vessel,\r\n'b'with the reporter, the engineer bent down and whispered,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf there is one thing certain in this world, Spilett, it is that I\r\n'b'never lighted any fire during the night of the 19th of October, neither\r\n'b'on Prospect Heights nor on any other part of the island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 20\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Things happened as Pencroft had predicted, he being seldom mistaken in\r\n'b'his prognostications. The wind rose, and from a fresh breeze it soon\r\n'b'increased to a regular gale; that is to say, it acquired a speed of from\r\n'b'forty to forty-five miles an hour, before which a ship in the open sea\r\n'b'would have run under close-reefed topsails. Now, as it was nearly six\r\n'b'o\xe2\x80\x99clock when the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d reached the gulf, and as at that\r\n'b'moment the tide turned, it was impossible to enter. They were therefore\r\n'b'compelled to stand off, for even if he had wished to do so, Pencroft\r\n'b'could not have gained the mouth of the Mercy. Hoisting the jib to the\r\n'b'mainmast by way of a storm-sail, he hove to, putting the head of the\r\n'b'vessel towards the land.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Fortunately, although the wind was strong the sea, being sheltered by\r\n'b'the land, did not run very high. They had then little to fear from\r\n'b'the waves, which always endanger small craft. The \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d would\r\n'b'doubtlessly not have capsized, for she was well ballasted, but enormous\r\n'b'masses of water falling on the deck might injure her if her timbers\r\n'b'could not sustain them. Pencroft, as a good sailor, was prepared\r\n'b'for anything. Certainly, he had great confidence in his vessel, but\r\n'b'nevertheless he awaited the return of day with some anxiety.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the night, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett had no opportunity\r\n'b'for talking together, and yet the words pronounced in the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'ear by the engineer were well worth being discussed, together with the\r\n'b'mysterious influence which appeared to reign over Lincoln Island. Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett did not cease from pondering over this new and inexplicable\r\n'b'incident, the appearance of a fire on the coast of the island. The fire\r\n'b'had actually been seen! His companions, Herbert and Pencroft, had seen\r\n'b'it with him! The fire had served to signalize the position of the island\r\n'b'during that dark night, and they had not doubted that it was lighted by\r\n'b'the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s hand; and here was Cyrus Harding expressly declaring that\r\n'b'he had never done anything of the sort! Spilett resolved to recur to\r\n'b'this incident as soon as the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d returned, and to urge Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding to acquaint their companions with these strange facts. Perhaps\r\n'b'it would be decided to make in common a complete investigation of every\r\n'b'part of Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However that might be, on this evening no fire was lighted on these yet\r\n'b'unknown shores, which formed the entrance to the gulf, and the little\r\n'b'vessel stood off during the night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When the first streaks of dawn appeared in the western horizon, the\r\n'b'wind, which had slightly fallen, shifted two points, and enabled\r\n'b'Pencroft to enter the narrow gulf with greater ease. Towards seven\r\n'b'o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d weathering the North\r\n'b'Mandible Cape, entered the strait and glided on to the waters, so\r\n'b'strangely enclosed in the frame of lava.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthis bay would make admirable roads, in which a\r\n'b'whole fleet could lie at their ease!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is especially curious,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cis that the gulf\r\n'b'has been formed by two rivers of lava, thrown out by the volcano, and\r\n'b'accumulated by successive eruptions. The result is that the gulf is\r\n'b'completely sheltered on all sides, and I believe that even in the\r\n'b'stormiest weather, the sea here must be as calm as a lake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9csince the wind has only that narrow\r\n'b'entrance between the two capes to get in by, and, besides, the north\r\n'b'cape protects that of the south in a way which would make the entrance\r\n'b'of gusts very difficult. I declare our \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 could stay here\r\n'b'from one end of the year to the other, without even dragging at her\r\n'b'anchor!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is rather large for her!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell! Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI agree that it is too large\r\n'b'for the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure,\xe2\x80\x99 but if the fleets of the Union were in want of a\r\n'b'harbor in the Pacific, I don\xe2\x80\x99t think they would ever find a better place\r\n'b'than this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are in the shark\xe2\x80\x99s mouth,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Neb, alluding to the form of the\r\n'b'gulf.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cRight into its mouth, my honest Neb!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cbut you are not\r\n'b'afraid that it will shut upon us, are you?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Mr. Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cand yet this gulf here doesn\xe2\x80\x99t please\r\n'b'me much! It has a wicked look!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHallo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9chere is Neb turning up his nose at my gulf,\r\n'b'just as I was thinking of presenting it to America!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, at any rate, is the water deep enough?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cfor a\r\n'b'depth sufficient for the keel of the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 would not be enough\r\n'b'for those of our iron-clads.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is easily found out,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the sailor sounded with a long cord, which served him as a\r\n'b'lead-line, and to which was fastened a lump of iron. This cord measured\r\n'b'nearly fifty fathoms, and its entire length was unrolled without finding\r\n'b'any bottom.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cour iron-clads can come here after all!\r\n'b'They would not run aground!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cthis gulf is a regular abyss, but,\r\n'b'taking into consideration the volcanic origin of the island, it is not\r\n'b'astonishing that the sea should offer similar depressions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOne would say too,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat these cliffs were perfectly\r\n'b'perpendicular; and I believe that at their foot, even with a line five\r\n'b'or six times longer, Pencroft would not find bottom.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is all very well,\xe2\x80\x9d then said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I must point out\r\n'b'to Pencroft that his harbor is wanting in one very important respect!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what is that, Mr. Spilett?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAn opening, a cutting of some sort, to give access to the interior of\r\n'b'the island. I do not see a spot on which we could land.\xe2\x80\x9d And, in\r\n'b'fact, the steep lava cliffs did not afford a single place suitable for\r\n'b'landing. They formed an insuperable barrier, recalling, but with more\r\n'b'wildness, the fiords of Norway. The \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure,\xe2\x80\x9d coasting as close\r\n'b'as possible along the cliffs, did not discover even a projection which\r\n'b'would allow the passengers to leave the deck.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft consoled himself by saying that with the help of a mine they\r\n'b'could soon open out the cliff when that was necessary, and then, as\r\n'b'there was evidently nothing to be done in the gulf, he steered his\r\n'b'vessel towards the strait and passed out at about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the\r\n'b'afternoon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, uttering a sigh of satisfaction.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'One might really say that the honest Negro did not feel at his ease in\r\n'b'those enormous jaws.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The distance from Mandible Cape to the mouth of the Mercy was not more\r\n'b'than eight miles. The head of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was put towards Granite\r\n'b'House, and a fair wind filling her sails, she ran rapidly along the\r\n'b'coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To the enormous lava rocks succeeded soon those capricious sand dunes,\r\n'b'among which the engineer had been so singularly recovered, and which\r\n'b'seabirds frequented in thousands.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About four o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Pencroft leaving the point of the islet on his\r\n'b'left, entered the channel which separated it from the coast, and at five\r\n'b'o\xe2\x80\x99clock the anchor of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was buried in the sand at the\r\n'b'mouth of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists had been absent three days from their dwelling. Ayrton\r\n'b'was waiting for them on the beach, and Jup came joyously to meet them,\r\n'b'giving vent to deep grunts of satisfaction.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A complete exploration of the coast of the island had now been made,\r\n'b'and no suspicious appearances had been observed. If any mysterious being\r\n'b'resided on it, it could only be under cover of the impenetrable forest\r\n'b'of the Serpentine Peninsula, to which the colonists had not yet directed\r\n'b'their investigations.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett discussed these things with the engineer, and it was\r\n'b'agreed that they should direct the attention of their companions to the\r\n'b'strange character of certain incidents which had occurred on the island,\r\n'b'and of which the last was the most unaccountable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, Harding, returning to the fact of a fire having been kindled on\r\n'b'the shore by an unknown hand, could not refrain from repeating for the\r\n'b'twentieth time to the reporter,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut are you quite sure of having seen it? Was it not a partial eruption\r\n'b'of the volcano, or perhaps some meteor?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cit was certainly a fire lighted by\r\n'b'the hand of man. Besides; question Pencroft and Herbert. They saw it as\r\n'b'I saw it myself, and they will confirm my words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In consequence, therefore, a few days after, on the 25th of April, in\r\n'b'the evening, when the settlers were all collected on Prospect Heights,\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding began by saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends, I think it my duty to call your attention to certain\r\n'b'incidents which have occurred in the island, on the subject of which I\r\n'b'shall be happy to have your advice. These incidents are, so to speak,\r\n'b'supernatural--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSupernatural!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor, emitting a volume of smoke from\r\n'b'his mouth. \xe2\x80\x9cCan it be possible that our island is supernatural?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft, but mysterious, most certainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer;\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cunless you can explain that which Spilett and I have until now failed\r\n'b'to understand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpeak away, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, have you understood,\xe2\x80\x9d then said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9chow was it that\r\n'b'after falling into the sea, I was found a quarter of a mile into the\r\n'b'interior of the island, and that, without my having any consciousness of\r\n'b'my removal there?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnless, being unconscious--\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not admissible,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cBut to continue. Have\r\n'b'you understood how Top was able to discover your retreat five miles from\r\n'b'the cave in which I was lying?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe dog\xe2\x80\x99s instinct--\xe2\x80\x9d observed Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSingular instinct!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9csince notwithstanding the\r\n'b'storm of rain and wind which was raging during that night, Top arrived\r\n'b'at the Chimneys, dry and without a speck of mud!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us continue,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you understood how our\r\n'b'dog was so strangely thrown up out of the water of the lake, after his\r\n'b'struggle with the dugong?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I confess, not at all,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand the wound which the\r\n'b'dugong had in its side, a wound which seemed to have been made with a\r\n'b'sharp instrument; that can\xe2\x80\x99t be understood, either.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us continue again,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cHave you understood, my friends,\r\n'b'how that bullet got into the body of the young peccary; how that case\r\n'b'happened to be so fortunately stranded, without there being any trace\r\n'b'of a wreck; how that bottle containing the document presented itself\r\n'b'so opportunely, during our first sea-excursion; how our canoe, having\r\n'b'broken its moorings, floated down the current of the Mercy and rejoined\r\n'b'us at the very moment we needed it; how after the ape invasion the\r\n'b'ladder was so obligingly thrown down from Granite House; and lastly, how\r\n'b'the document, which Ayrton asserts was never written by him, fell into\r\n'b'our hands?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As Cyrus Harding thus enumerated, without forgetting one, the singular\r\n'b'incidents which had occurred in the island, Herbert, Neb, and Pencroft\r\n'b'stared at each other, not knowing what to reply, for this succession of\r\n'b'incidents, grouped thus for the first time, could not but excite their\r\n'b'surprise to the highest degree.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft at last, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are right, captain, and it\r\n'b'is difficult to explain all these things!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9ca last fact has just been\r\n'b'added to these, and it is no less incomprehensible than the others!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert quickly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhen you were returning from Tabor Island, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the\r\n'b'engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou said that a fire appeared on Lincoln Island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you are quite certain of having seen this fire?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs sure as I see you now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou also, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthat fire was blazing like a star of the\r\n'b'first magnitude!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut was it not a star?\xe2\x80\x9d urged the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the sky was covered with thick clouds, and\r\n'b'at any rate a star would not have been so low on the horizon. But Mr.\r\n'b'Spilett saw it as well as we, and he will confirm our words.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will add,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the fire was very bright, and\r\n'b'that it shot up like a sheet of lightning.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes! exactly,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand it was certainly placed on the\r\n'b'heights of Granite House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cduring the night of the 19th\r\n'b'of October, neither Neb nor I lighted any fire on the coast.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou did not!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, in the height of his astonishment,\r\n'b'not being able to finish his sentence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe did not leave Granite House,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand if a fire\r\n'b'appeared on the coast, it was lighted by another hand than ours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb were stupefied. No illusion could be\r\n'b'possible, and a fire had actually met their eyes during the night of the\r\n'b'19th of October. Yes! they had to acknowledge it, a mystery existed! An\r\n'b'inexplicable influence, evidently favorable to the colonists, but very\r\n'b'irritating to their curiosity, was executed always in the nick of time\r\n'b'on Lincoln Island. Could there be some being hidden in its profoundest\r\n'b'recesses? It was necessary at any cost to ascertain this.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding also reminded his companions of the singular behavior of Top and\r\n'b'Jup when they prowled round the mouth of the well, which placed Granite\r\n'b'House in communication with the sea, and he told them that he had\r\n'b'explored the well, without discovering anything suspicious. The final\r\n'b'resolve taken, in consequence of this conversation, by all the members\r\n'b'of the colony, was that as soon as the fine season returned they would\r\n'b'thoroughly search the whole of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But from that day Pencroft appeared to be anxious. He felt as if the\r\n'b'island which he had made his own personal property belonged to him\r\n'b'entirely no longer, and that he shared it with another master, to\r\n'b'whom, willing or not, he felt subject. Neb and he often talked of those\r\n'b'unaccountable things, and both, their natures inclining them to the\r\n'b'marvelous, were not far from believing that Lincoln Island was under the\r\n'b'dominion of some supernatural power.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, the bad weather came with the month of May, the\r\n'b'November of the northern zones. It appeared that the winter would\r\n'b'be severe and forward. The preparations for the winter season were\r\n'b'therefore commenced without delay.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nevertheless, the colonists were well prepared to meet the winter,\r\n'b'however hard it might be. They had plenty of felt clothing, and the\r\n'b'musmons, very numerous by this time, had furnished an abundance of wool\r\n'b'necessary for the manufacture of this warm material.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is unnecessary to say that Ayrton had been provided with this\r\n'b'comfortable clothing. Cyrus Harding proposed that he should come to\r\n'b'spend the bad season with them in Granite House, where he would be\r\n'b'better lodged than at the corral, and Ayrton promised to do so, as soon\r\n'b'as the last work at the corral was finished. He did this towards the\r\n'b'middle of April. From that time Ayrton shared the common life, and made\r\n'b'himself useful on all occasions; but still humble and sad, he never took\r\n'b'part in the pleasures of his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For the greater part of this, the third winter which the settlers passed\r\n'b'in Lincoln Island, they were confined to Granite House. There were many\r\n'b'violent storms and frightful tempests, which appeared to shake the rocks\r\n'b'to their very foundations. Immense waves threatened to overwhelm the\r\n'b'island, and certainly any vessel anchored near the shore would have\r\n'b'been dashed to pieces. Twice, during one of these hurricanes, the Mercy\r\n'b'swelled to such a degree as to give reason to fear that the bridges\r\n'b'would be swept away, and it was necessary to strengthen those on the\r\n'b'shore, which disappeared under the foaming waters, when the sea beat\r\n'b'against the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It may well be supposed that such storms, comparable to water-spouts in\r\n'b'which were mingled rain and snow, would cause great havoc on the\r\n'b'plateau of Prospect Heights. The mill and the poultry-yard particularly\r\n'b'suffered. The colonists were often obliged to make immediate repairs,\r\n'b'without which the safety of the birds would have been seriously\r\n'b'threatened.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the worst weather, several jaguars and troops of quadrumana\r\n'b'ventured to the edge of the plateau, and it was always to be feared that\r\n'b'the most active and audacious would, urged by hunger, manage to cross\r\n'b'the stream, which besides, when frozen, offered them an easy passage.\r\n'b'Plantations and domestic animals would then have been infallibly\r\n'b'destroyed, without a constant watch, and it was often necessary to\r\n'b'make use of the guns to keep those dangerous visitors at a respectful\r\n'b'distance. Occupation was not wanting to the colonists, for without\r\n'b'reckoning their out-door cares, they had always a thousand plans for the\r\n'b'fitting up of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had also some fine sporting excursions, which were made during the\r\n'b'frost in the vast Tadorn Marsh. Gideon Spilett and Herbert, aided by\r\n'b'Jup and Top, did not miss a shot in the midst of myriads of wild-duck,\r\n'b'snipe, teal, and others. The access to these hunting-grounds was easy;\r\n'b'besides, whether they reached them by the road to Port Balloon, after\r\n'b'having passed the Mercy Bridge, or by turning the rocks from Flotsam\r\n'b'Point, the hunters were never distant from Granite House more than two\r\n'b'or three miles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus passed the four winter months, which were really rigorous, that is\r\n'b'to say, June, July, August, and September. But, in short, Granite House\r\n'b'did not suffer much from the inclemency of the weather, and it was\r\n'b'the same with the corral, which, less exposed than the plateau, and\r\n'b'sheltered partly by Mount Franklin, only received the remains of the\r\n'b'hurricanes, already broken by the forests and the high rocks of the\r\n'b'shore. The damages there were consequently of small importance, and the\r\n'b'activity and skill of Ayrton promptly repaired them, when some time in\r\n'b'October he returned to pass a few days in the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this winter, no fresh inexplicable incident occurred. Nothing\r\n'b'strange happened, although Pencroft and Neb were on the watch for the\r\n'b'most insignificant facts to which they attached any mysterious cause.\r\n'b'Top and Jup themselves no longer growled round the well or gave any\r\n'b'signs of uneasiness. It appeared, therefore, as if the series of\r\n'b'supernatural incidents was interrupted, although they often talked of\r\n'b'them during the evenings in Granite House, and they remained thoroughly\r\n'b'resolved that the island should be searched, even in those parts the\r\n'b'most difficult to explore. But an event of the highest importance, and\r\n'b'of which the consequences might be terrible, momentarily diverted from\r\n'b'their projects Cyrus Harding and his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the month of October. The fine season was swiftly returning.\r\n'b'Nature was reviving; and among the evergreen foliage of the coniferae\r\n'b'which formed the border of the wood, already appeared the young leaves\r\n'b'of the banksias, deodars, and other trees.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It may be remembered that Gideon Spilett and Herbert had, at different\r\n'b'times, taken photographic views of Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now, on the 17th of this month of October, towards three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\n'b'the afternoon, Herbert, enticed by the charms of the sky, thought of\r\n'b'reproducing Union Bay, which was opposite to Prospect Heights, from Cape\r\n'b'Mandible to Claw Cape.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The horizon was beautifully clear, and the sea, undulating under a soft\r\n'b'breeze, was as calm as the waters of a lake, sparkling here and there\r\n'b'under the sun\xe2\x80\x99s rays.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The apparatus had been placed at one of the windows of the dining-room\r\n'b'at Granite House, and consequently overlooked the shore and the bay.\r\n'b'Herbert proceeded as he was accustomed to do, and the negative obtained,\r\n'b'he went away to fix it by means of the chemicals deposited in a dark\r\n'b'nook of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Returning to the bright light, and examining it well, Herbert perceived\r\n'b'on his negative an almost imperceptible little spot on the sea horizon.\r\n'b'He endeavored to make it disappear by reiterated washing, but could not\r\n'b'accomplish it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a flaw in the glass,\xe2\x80\x9d he thought.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And then he had the curiosity to examine this flaw with a strong\r\n'b'magnifier which he unscrewed from one of the telescopes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But he had scarcely looked at it, when he uttered a cry, and the glass\r\n'b'almost fell from his hands.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Immediately running to the room in which Cyrus Harding then was, he\r\n'b'extended the negative and magnifier towards the engineer, pointing out\r\n'b'the little spot.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding examined it; then seizing his telescope he rushed to the window.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The telescope, after having slowly swept the horizon, at last stopped on\r\n'b'the looked-for spot, and Cyrus Harding, lowering it, pronounced one word\r\n'b'only,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA vessel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And in fact a vessel was in sight, off Lincoln Island!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'PART 3\r\n'b'\r\n'b'THE SECRET OF THE ISLAND\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 1\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now two years and a half since the castaways from the balloon had\r\n'b'been thrown on Lincoln Island, and during that period there had been no\r\n'b'communication between them and their fellow-creatures. Once the reporter\r\n'b'had attempted to communicate with the inhabited world by confiding to\r\n'b'a bird a letter which contained the secret of their situation, but that\r\n'b'was a chance on which it was impossible to reckon seriously. Ayrton,\r\n'b'alone, under the circumstances which have been related, had come to\r\n'b'join the little colony. Now, suddenly, on this day, the 17th of October,\r\n'b'other men had unexpectedly appeared in sight of the island, on that\r\n'b'deserted sea!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There could be no doubt about it! A vessel was there! But would she\r\n'b'pass on, or would she put into port? In a few hours the colonists would\r\n'b'definitely know what to expect.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Herbert having immediately called Gideon Spilett,\r\n'b'Pencroft, and Neb into the dining-room of Granite House, told them\r\n'b'what had happened. Pencroft, seizing the telescope, rapidly swept the\r\n'b'horizon, and stopping on the indicated point, that is to say, on\r\n'b'that which had made the almost imperceptible spot on the photographic\r\n'b'negative,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99m blessed but it is really a vessel!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed, in a voice which\r\n'b'did not express any great amount of satisfaction.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs she coming here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cImpossible to say anything yet,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cfor her rigging\r\n'b'alone is above the horizon, and not a bit of her hull can be seen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is to be done?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the lad.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWait,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And for a considerable time the settlers remained silent, given up to\r\n'b'all the thoughts, and the emotions, all the fears, all the hopes, which\r\n'b'were aroused by this incident--the most important which had occurred\r\n'b'since their arrival in Lincoln Island. Certainly, the colonists were not\r\n'b'in the situation of castaways abandoned on a sterile islet, constantly\r\n'b'contending against a cruel nature for their miserable existence, and\r\n'b'incessantly tormented by the longing to return to inhabited countries.\r\n'b'Pencroft and Neb, especially, who felt themselves at once so happy and\r\n'b'so rich, would not have left their island without regret. They were\r\n'b'accustomed, besides, to this new life in the midst of the domain which\r\n'b'their intelligence had as it were civilized. But at any rate this ship\r\n'b'brought news from the world, perhaps even from their native land. It was\r\n'b'bringing fellow-creatures to them, and it may be conceived how deeply\r\n'b'their hearts were moved at the sight!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From time to time Pencroft took the glass and rested himself at the\r\n'b'window. From thence he very attentively examined the vessel, which was\r\n'b'at a distance of twenty miles to the east. The colonists had as yet,\r\n'b'therefore, no means of signalizing their presence. A flag would not have\r\n'b'been perceived; a gun would not have been heard; a fire would not have\r\n'b'been visible. However, it was certain that the island, overtopped by\r\n'b'Mount Franklin, could not escape the notice of the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s lookout. But\r\n'b'why was the ship coming there? Was it simple chance which brought it to\r\n'b'that part of the Pacific, where the maps mentioned no land except Tabor\r\n'b'Island, which itself was out of the route usually followed by vessels\r\n'b'from the Polynesian Archipelagoes, from New Zealand, and from the\r\n'b'American coast? To this question, which each one asked himself, a reply\r\n'b'was suddenly made by Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCan it be the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d he cried.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cDuncan,\xe2\x80\x9d as has been said, was Lord Glenarvan\xe2\x80\x99s yacht, which had\r\n'b'left Ayrton on the islet, and which was to return there someday to fetch\r\n'b'him. Now, the islet was not so far distant from Lincoln Island, but\r\n'b'that a vessel, standing for the one, could pass in sight of the other. A\r\n'b'hundred and fifty miles only separated them in longitude, and seventy in\r\n'b'latitude.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must tell Ayrton,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand send for him\r\n'b'immediately. He alone can say if it is the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was the opinion of all, and the reporter, going to the telegraphic\r\n'b'apparatus which placed the corral in communication with Granite House,\r\n'b'sent this telegram:--\xe2\x80\x9cCome with all possible speed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few minutes the bell sounded.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am coming,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then the settlers continued to watch the vessel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf it is the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cAyrton will recognize her\r\n'b'without difficulty, since he sailed on board her for some time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd if he recognizes her,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cit will agitate him\r\n'b'exceedingly!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding; \xe2\x80\x9cbut now Ayrton is worthy to return on\r\n'b'board the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan,\xe2\x80\x99 and pray Heaven that it is indeed Lord Glenarvan\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'yacht, for I should be suspicious of any other vessel. These are\r\n'b'ill-famed seas, and I have always feared a visit from Malay pirates to\r\n'b'our island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe could defend it,\xe2\x80\x99, cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer smiling, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it would be\r\n'b'better not to have to defend it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA useless observation,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln Island is unknown to\r\n'b'navigators, since it is not marked even on the most recent maps. Do\r\n'b'you think, Cyrus, that that is a sufficient motive for a ship, finding\r\n'b'herself unexpectedly in sight of new land, to try and visit rather than\r\n'b'avoid it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think so too,\xe2\x80\x9d added the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt may even be said that it is\r\n'b'the duty of a captain to come and survey any land or island not yet\r\n'b'known, and Lincoln Island is in this position.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9csuppose this vessel comes and anchors there a\r\n'b'few cables-lengths from our island, what shall we do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This sudden question remained at first without any reply. But Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding, after some moments\xe2\x80\x99 thought, replied in the calm tone which was\r\n'b'usual to him,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat we shall do, my friends? What we ought to do is this:--we will\r\n'b'communicate with the ship, we will take our passage on board her, and we\r\n'b'will leave our island, after having taken possession of it in the name\r\n'b'of the United States. Then we will return with any who may wish to\r\n'b'follow us to colonize it definitely, and endow the American Republic\r\n'b'with a useful station in this part of the Pacific Ocean!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand that will be no small present\r\n'b'which we shall make to our country! The colonization is already almost\r\n'b'finished; names are given to every part of the island; there is\r\n'b'a natural port, fresh water, roads, a telegraph, a dockyard, and\r\n'b'manufactories; and there will be nothing to be done but to inscribe\r\n'b'Lincoln Island on the maps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut if anyone seizes it in our absence?\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHang it!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cI would rather remain all alone to guard\r\n'b'it: and trust to Pencroft, they shouldn\xe2\x80\x99t steal it from him, like a\r\n'b'watch from the pocket of a swell!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For an hour it was impossible to say with any certainty whether the\r\n'b'vessel was or was not standing towards Lincoln Island. She was\r\n'b'nearer, but in what direction was she sailing? This Pencroft could not\r\n'b'determine. However, as the wind was blowing from the northeast, in all\r\n'b'probability the vessel was sailing on the starboard tack. Besides, the\r\n'b'wind was favorable for bringing her towards the island, and, the sea\r\n'b'being calm, she would not be afraid to approach although the shallows\r\n'b'were not marked on the chart.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards four o\xe2\x80\x99clock--an hour after he had been sent for--Ayrton arrived\r\n'b'at Granite House. He entered the dining-room saying,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt your service, gentlemen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding gave him his hand, as was his custom to do, and, leading\r\n'b'him to the window,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwe have begged you to come here for an important\r\n'b'reason. A ship is in sight of the island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton at first paled slightly, and for a moment his eyes became dim;\r\n'b'then, leaning out the window, he surveyed the horizon, but could see\r\n'b'nothing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTake this telescope,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand look carefully, Ayrton, for\r\n'b'it is possible that this ship may be the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 come to these seas for\r\n'b'the purpose of taking you home again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Duncan!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Ayrton. \xe2\x80\x9cAlready?\xe2\x80\x9d This last word escaped\r\n'b'Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s lips as if involuntarily, and his head drooped upon his hands.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Did not twelve years\xe2\x80\x99 solitude on a desert island appear to him a\r\n'b'sufficient expiation? Did not the penitent yet feel himself pardoned,\r\n'b'either in his own eyes or in the eyes of others?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cno! it cannot be the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook, Ayrton,\xe2\x80\x9d then said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it is necessary that we\r\n'b'should know beforehand what to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton took the glass and pointed it in the direction indicated. During\r\n'b'some minutes he examined the horizon without moving, without uttering a\r\n'b'word. Then,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is indeed a vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I do not think she is the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Duncan.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy do you not think so?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBecause the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99 is a steam-yacht, and I cannot perceive any trace\r\n'b'of smoke either above or near that vessel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps she is simply sailing,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wind is\r\n'b'favorable for the direction which she appears to be taking, and she may\r\n'b'be anxious to economize her coal, being so far from land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible that you may be right, Mr. Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ayrton,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cand that the vessel has extinguished her fires. We must wait until she\r\n'b'is nearer, and then we shall soon know what to expect.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So saying, Ayrton sat down in a corner of the room and remained silent.\r\n'b'The colonists again discussed the strange ship, but Ayrton took no\r\n'b'part in the conversation. All were in such a mood that they found it\r\n'b'impossible to continue their work. Gideon Spilett and Pencroft were\r\n'b'particularly nervous, going, coming, not able to remain still in one\r\n'b'place. Herbert felt more curiosity. Neb alone maintained his usual\r\n'b'calm manner. Was not his country that where his master was? As to the\r\n'b'engineer, he remained plunged in deep thought, and in his heart feared\r\n'b'rather than desired the arrival of the ship. In the meanwhile, the\r\n'b'vessel was a little nearer the island. With the aid of the glass, it was\r\n'b'ascertained that she was a brig, and not one of those Malay proas, which\r\n'b'are generally used by the pirates of the Pacific. It was, therefore,\r\n'b'reasonable to believe that the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s apprehensions would not be\r\n'b'justified, and that the presence of this vessel in the vicinity of the\r\n'b'island was fraught with no danger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, after a minute examination, was able positively to affirm that\r\n'b'the vessel was rigged as a brig, and that she was standing obliquely\r\n'b'towards the coast, on the starboard tack, under her topsails and\r\n'b'top-gallant-sails. This was confirmed by Ayrton. But by continuing in\r\n'b'this direction she must soon disappear behind Claw Cape, as the wind\r\n'b'was from the southwest, and to watch her it would be then necessary\r\n'b'to ascend the height of Washington Bay, near Port Balloon--a provoking\r\n'b'circumstance, for it was already five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening, and the\r\n'b'twilight would soon make any observation extremely difficult.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we do when night comes on?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cShall we\r\n'b'light a fire, so as to signal our presence on the coast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was a serious question, and yet, although the engineer still\r\n'b'retained some of his presentiments, it was answered in the affirmative.\r\n'b'During the night the ship might disappear and leave for ever, and, this\r\n'b'ship gone, would another ever return to the waters of Lincoln Island?\r\n'b'Who could foresee what the future would then have in store for the\r\n'b'colonists?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cwe ought to make known to that vessel,\r\n'b'whoever she may be, that the island is inhabited. To neglect the\r\n'b'opportunity which is offered to us might be to create everlasting\r\n'b'regrets.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was therefore decided that Neb and Pencroft should go to Port\r\n'b'Balloon, and that there, at nightfall, they should light an immense\r\n'b'fire, the blaze of which would necessarily attract the attention of the\r\n'b'brig.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But at the moment when Neb and the sailor were preparing to leave\r\n'b'Granite House, the vessel suddenly altered her course, and stood\r\n'b'directly for Union Bay. The brig was a good sailer, for she approached\r\n'b'rapidly. Neb and Pencroft put off their departure, therefore, and the\r\n'b'glass was put into Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s hands, that he might ascertain for certain\r\n'b'whether the ship was or was not the \xe2\x80\x9cDuncan.\xe2\x80\x9d The Scotch yacht was also\r\n'b'rigged as a brig. The question was, whether a chimney could be discerned\r\n'b'between the two masts of the vessel, which was now at a distance of only\r\n'b'five miles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The horizon was still very clear. The examination was easy, and Ayrton\r\n'b'soon let the glass fall again, saying--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99! It could not be!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft again brought the brig within the range of the telescope, and\r\n'b'could see that she was of between three and four hundred tons burden,\r\n'b'wonderfully narrow, well-masted, admirably built, and must be a very\r\n'b'rapid sailer. But to what nation did she belong? That was difficult to\r\n'b'say.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d added the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9ca flag is floating from her peak, but I\r\n'b'cannot distinguish the colors of it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn half an hour we shall be certain about that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, it is very evident that the intention of the captain of this\r\n'b'ship is to land, and, consequently, if not today, to-morrow at the\r\n'b'latest, we shall make his acquaintance.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever mind!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is best to know whom we have to deal\r\n'b'with, and I shall not be sorry to recognize that fellow\xe2\x80\x99s colors!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, while thus speaking, the sailor never left the glass. The day began\r\n'b'to fade, and with the day the breeze fell also. The brig\xe2\x80\x99s ensign hung\r\n'b'in folds, and it became more and more difficult to observe it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not the American flag,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft from time to time, \xe2\x80\x9cnor the\r\n'b'English, the red of which could be easily seen, nor the French or German\r\n'b'colors, nor the white flag of Russia, nor the yellow of Spain. One would\r\n'b'say it was all one color. Let\xe2\x80\x99s see: in these seas, what do we generally\r\n'b'meet with? The Chilean flag?--but that is tri-color. Brazilian?--it is\r\n'b'green. Japanese?--it is yellow and black, while this--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment the breeze blew out the unknown flag. Ayrton seizing the\r\n'b'telescope which the sailor had put down, put it to his eye, and in a\r\n'b'hoarse voice,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe black flag!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And indeed the somber bunting was floating from the mast of the brig,\r\n'b'and they had now good reason for considering her to be a suspicious\r\n'b'vessel!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Had the engineer, then, been right in his presentiments? Was this a\r\n'b'pirate vessel? Did she scour the Pacific, competing with the Malay proas\r\n'b'which still infest it? For what had she come to look at the shores of\r\n'b'Lincoln Island? Was it to them an unknown island, ready to become\r\n'b'a magazine for stolen cargoes? Had she come to find on the coast a\r\n'b'sheltered port for the winter months? Was the settlers\xe2\x80\x99 honest domain\r\n'b'destined to be transformed into an infamous refuge--the headquarters of\r\n'b'the piracy of the Pacific?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All these ideas instinctively presented themselves to the colonists\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'imaginations. There was no doubt, besides, of the signification which\r\n'b'must be attached to the color of the hoisted flag. It was that of\r\n'b'pirates! It was that which the \xe2\x80\x9cDuncan\xe2\x80\x9d would have carried, had the\r\n'b'convicts succeeded in their criminal design! No time was lost before\r\n'b'discussing it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps this vessel only wishes to\r\n'b'survey the coast of the island. Perhaps her crew will not land. There is\r\n'b'a chance of it. However that may be, we ought to do everything we can to\r\n'b'hide our presence here. The windmill on Prospect Heights is too easily\r\n'b'seen. Let Ayrton and Neb go and take down the sails. We must also\r\n'b'conceal the windows of Granite House with thick branches. All the fires\r\n'b'must be extinguished, so that nothing may betray the presence of men on\r\n'b'the island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd our vessel?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cshe is sheltered in Port Balloon, and I defy\r\n'b'any of those rascals there to find her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s orders were immediately executed. Neb and Ayrton\r\n'b'ascended the plateau, and took the necessary precautions to conceal\r\n'b'any indication of a settlement. While they were thus occupied, their\r\n'b'companions went to the border of Jacamar Wood, and brought back a large\r\n'b'quantity of branches and creepers, which would at some distance appear\r\n'b'as natural foliage, and thus disguise the windows in the granite cliff.\r\n'b'At the same time, the ammunition and guns were placed ready so as to be\r\n'b'at hand in case of an unexpected attack.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When all these precautions had been taken,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding, and his voice betrayed some emotion, \xe2\x80\x9cif the\r\n'b'wretches endeavor to seize Lincoln Island, we shall defend it--shall we\r\n'b'not?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand if necessary we will die to\r\n'b'defend it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer extended his hand to his companions, who pressed it warmly.\r\n'b'Ayrton remained in his corner, not joining the colonists. Perhaps he,\r\n'b'the former convict, still felt himself unworthy to do so!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding understood what was passing in Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s mind, and going to\r\n'b'him--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Ayrton,\xe2\x80\x9d he asked, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat will you do?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy duty,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He then took up his station near the window and gazed through the\r\n'b'foliage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now half-past seven. The sun had disappeared twenty minutes ago\r\n'b'behind Granite House. Consequently the Eastern horizon was becoming\r\n'b'obscured. In the meanwhile the brig continued to advance towards Union\r\n'b'Bay. She was now not more than two miles off, and exactly opposite the\r\n'b'plateau of Prospect Heights, for after having tacked off Claw Cape, she\r\n'b'had drifted towards the north in the current of the rising tide. One\r\n'b'might have said that at this distance she had already entered the vast\r\n'b'bay, for a straight line drawn from Claw Cape to Cape Mandible would\r\n'b'have rested on her starboard quarter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Was the brig about to penetrate far into the bay? That was the first\r\n'b'question. When once in the bay, would she anchor there? That was the\r\n'b'second. Would she not content herself with only surveying the coast, and\r\n'b'stand out to sea again without landing her crew? They would know this in\r\n'b'an hour. The colonists could do nothing but wait.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had not seen the suspected vessel hoist the black flag\r\n'b'without deep anxiety. Was it not a direct menace against the work which\r\n'b'he and his companions had till now conducted so successfully? Had these\r\n'b'pirates--for the sailors of the brig could be nothing else--already\r\n'b'visited the island, since on approaching it they had hoisted their\r\n'b'colors. Had they formerly invaded it, so that certain unaccountable\r\n'b'peculiarities might be explained in this way? Did there exist in the as\r\n'b'yet unexplored parts some accomplice ready to enter into communication\r\n'b'with them?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To all these questions which he mentally asked himself, Harding knew not\r\n'b'what to reply; but he felt that the safety of the colony could not but\r\n'b'be seriously threatened by the arrival of the brig.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, he and his companions were determined to fight to the last\r\n'b'gasp. It would have been very important to know if the pirates\r\n'b'were numerous and better armed than the colonists. But how was this\r\n'b'information to be obtained?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Night fell. The new moon had disappeared. Profound darkness enveloped\r\n'b'the island and the sea. No light could pierce through the heavy piles\r\n'b'of clouds on the horizon. The wind had died away completely with the\r\n'b'twilight. Not a leaf rustled on the trees, not a ripple murmured on\r\n'b'the shore. Nothing could be seen of the ship, all her lights being\r\n'b'extinguished, and if she was still in sight of the island, her\r\n'b'whereabouts could not be discovered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell! who knows?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps that cursed craft will stand\r\n'b'off during the night, and we shall see nothing of her at daybreak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As if in reply to the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s observation, a bright light flashed in\r\n'b'the darkness, and a cannon-shot was heard.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The vessel was still there and had guns on board.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Six seconds elapsed between the flash and the report.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Therefore the brig was about a mile and a quarter from the coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At the same time, the chains were heard rattling through the\r\n'b'hawse-holes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The vessel had just anchored in sight of Granite House!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 2\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no longer any doubt as to the pirates\xe2\x80\x99 intentions. They had\r\n'b'dropped anchor at a short distance from the island, and it was evident\r\n'b'that the next day by means of their boats they purposed to land on the\r\n'b'beach!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions were ready to act, but, determined\r\n'b'though they were, they must not forget to be prudent. Perhaps their\r\n'b'presence might still be concealed in the event of the pirates contenting\r\n'b'themselves with landing on the shore without examining the interior of\r\n'b'the island. It might be, indeed, that their only intention was to obtain\r\n'b'fresh water from the Mercy, and it was not impossible that the bridge,\r\n'b'thrown across a mile and a half from the mouth, and the manufactory at\r\n'b'the Chimneys might escape their notice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But why was that flag hoisted at the brig\xe2\x80\x99s peak? What was that shot\r\n'b'fired for? Pure bravado doubtless, unless it was a sign of the act of\r\n'b'taking possession. Harding knew now that the vessel was well armed. And\r\n'b'what had the colonists of Lincoln Island to reply to the pirates\xe2\x80\x99 guns?\r\n'b'A few muskets only.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9chere we are in an impregnable\r\n'b'position. The enemy cannot discover the mouth of the outlet, now that it\r\n'b'is hidden under reeds and grass, and consequently it would be impossible\r\n'b'for them to penetrate into Granite House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut our plantations, our poultry-yard, our corral, all, everything!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' exclaimed Pencroft, stamping his foot. \xe2\x80\x9cThey may spoil everything,\r\n'b'destroy everything in a few hours!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEverything, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand we have no means of\r\n'b'preventing them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre they numerous? that is the question,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cIf they\r\n'b'are not more than a dozen, we shall be able to stop them, but forty,\r\n'b'fifty, more perhaps!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d then said Ayrton, advancing towards the engineer,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cwill you give me leave?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFor what, my friend?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo go to that vessel to find out the strength of her crew.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut Ayrton--\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, hesitating, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will risk your\r\n'b'life--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is more than your duty.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have more than my duty to do,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWill you go to the ship in the boat?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, sir, but I will swim. A boat would be seen where a man may glide\r\n'b'between wind and water.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you know that the brig is a mile and a quarter from the shore?\xe2\x80\x9d said\r\n'b'Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am a good swimmer, Mr. Herbert.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI tell you it is risking your life,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is no matter,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ayrton. \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding, I ask this as a\r\n'b'favor. Perhaps it will be a means of raising me in my own eyes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGo, Ayrton,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, who felt sure that a refusal would\r\n'b'have deeply wounded the former convict, now become an honest man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will accompany you,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou mistrust me!\xe2\x80\x9d said Ayrton quickly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then more humbly,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlas!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo! no!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Harding with animation, \xe2\x80\x9cno, Ayrton, Pencroft does\r\n'b'not mistrust you. You interpret his words wrongly.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cI only propose to accompany Ayrton as\r\n'b'far as the islet. It may be, although it is scarcely possible, that one\r\n'b'of these villains has landed, and in that case two men will not be too\r\n'b'many to hinder him from giving the alarm. I will wait for Ayrton on the\r\n'b'islet, and he shall go alone to the vessel, since he has proposed to do\r\n'b'so.\xe2\x80\x9d These things agreed to, Ayrton made preparations for his departure.\r\n'b'His plan was bold, but it might succeed, thanks to the darkness of the\r\n'b'night. Once arrived at the vessel\xe2\x80\x99s side, Ayrton, holding on to the main\r\n'b'chains, might reconnoiter the number and perhaps overhear the intentions\r\n'b'of the pirates.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton and Pencroft, followed by their companions, descended to the\r\n'b'beach. Ayrton undressed and rubbed himself with grease, so as to suffer\r\n'b'less from the temperature of the water, which was still cold. He might,\r\n'b'indeed, be obliged to remain in it for several hours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Neb, during this time, had gone to fetch the boat, moored\r\n'b'a few hundred feet higher up, on the bank of the Mercy, and by the time\r\n'b'they returned, Ayrton was ready to start. A coat was thrown over his\r\n'b'shoulders, and the settlers all came round him to press his hand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton then shoved off with Pencroft in the boat.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was half-past ten in the evening when the two adventurers disappeared\r\n'b'in the darkness. Their companions returned to wait at the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The channel was easily traversed, and the boat touched the opposite\r\n'b'shore of the islet. This was not done without precaution, for fear lest\r\n'b'the pirates might be roaming about there. But after a careful survey,\r\n'b'it was evident that the islet was deserted. Ayrton then, followed by\r\n'b'Pencroft, crossed it with a rapid step, scaring the birds nestled in the\r\n'b'holes of the rocks; then, without hesitating, he plunged into the sea,\r\n'b'and swam noiselessly in the direction of the ship, in which a few lights\r\n'b'had recently appeared, showing her exact situation. As to Pencroft,\r\n'b'he crouched down in a cleft of the rock, and awaited the return of his\r\n'b'companion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, Ayrton, swimming with a vigorous stroke, glided\r\n'b'through the sheet of water without producing the slightest ripple. His\r\n'b'head just emerged above it and his eyes were fixed on the dark hull of\r\n'b'the brig, from which the lights were reflected in the water. He thought\r\n'b'only of the duty which he had promised to accomplish, and nothing of the\r\n'b'danger which he ran, not only on board the ship, but in the sea, often\r\n'b'frequented by sharks. The current bore him along and he rapidly receded\r\n'b'from the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Half an hour afterwards, Ayrton, without having been either seen or\r\n'b'heard, arrived at the ship and caught hold of the main-chains. He took\r\n'b'breath, then, hoisting himself up, he managed to reach the extremity of\r\n'b'the cutwater. There were drying several pairs of sailors\xe2\x80\x99 trousers. He\r\n'b'put on a pair. Then settling himself firmly, he listened. They were not\r\n'b'sleeping on board the brig. On the contrary, they were talking, singing,\r\n'b'laughing. And these were the sentences, accompanied with oaths, which\r\n'b'principally struck Ayrton:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur brig is a famous acquisition.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe sails well, and merits her name of the \xe2\x80\x98Speedy.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe would show all the navy of Norfolk a clean pair of heels.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah for her captain!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHurrah for Bob Harvey!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What Ayrton felt when he overheard this fragment of conversation may be\r\n'b'understood when it is known that in this Bob Harvey he recognized one\r\n'b'of his old Australian companions, a daring sailor, who had continued his\r\n'b'criminal career. Bob Harvey had seized, on the shores of Norfolk Island\r\n'b'this brig, which was loaded with arms, ammunition, utensils, and tools\r\n'b'of all sorts, destined for one of the Sandwich Islands. All his gang had\r\n'b'gone on board, and pirates after having been convicts, these wretches,\r\n'b'more ferocious than the Malays themselves, scoured the Pacific,\r\n'b'destroying vessels, and massacring their crews.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The convicts spoke loudly, they recounted their deeds, drinking deeply\r\n'b'at the same time, and this is what Ayrton gathered. The actual crew\r\n'b'of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d was composed solely of English prisoners, escaped from\r\n'b'Norfolk Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Here it may be well to explain what this island was. In 29deg 2\xe2\x80\x99 south\r\n'b'latitude, and 165deg 42\xe2\x80\x99 east longitude, to the east of Australia, is\r\n'b'found a little island, six miles in circumference, overlooked by Mount\r\n'b'Pitt, which rises to a height of 1,100 feet above the level of the sea.\r\n'b'This is Norfolk Island, once the seat of an establishment in which were\r\n'b'lodged the most intractable convicts from the English penitentiaries.\r\n'b'They numbered 500, under an iron discipline, threatened with terrible\r\n'b'punishments, and were guarded by 150 soldiers, and 150 employed\r\n'b'under the orders of the governor. It would be difficult to imagine\r\n'b'a collection of greater ruffians. Sometimes,--although very\r\n'b'rarely,--notwithstanding the extreme surveillance of which they were\r\n'b'the object, many managed to escape, and seizing vessels which they\r\n'b'surprised, they infested the Polynesian Archipelagoes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus had Bob Harvey and his companions done. Thus had Ayrton formerly\r\n'b'wished to do. Bob Harvey had seized the brig \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy,\xe2\x80\x9d anchored in sight\r\n'b'of Norfolk Island; the crew had been massacred; and for a year this ship\r\n'b'had scoured the Pacific, under the command of Harvey, now a pirate, and\r\n'b'well known to Ayrton!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The convicts were, for the most part, assembled under the poop; but a\r\n'b'few, stretched on the deck, were talking loudly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The conversation still continued amid shouts and libations. Ayrton\r\n'b'learned that chance alone had brought the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d in sight of Lincoln\r\n'b'Island; Bob Harvey had never yet set foot on it; but, as Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'had conjectured, finding this unknown land in his course, its position\r\n'b'being marked on no chart, he had formed the project of visiting it, and,\r\n'b'if he found it suitable, of making it the brig\xe2\x80\x99s headquarters.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the black flag hoisted at the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d peak, and the gun which\r\n'b'had been fired, in imitation of men-of-war when they lower their\r\n'b'colors, it was pure piratical bravado. It was in no way a signal, and no\r\n'b'communication yet existed between the convicts and Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers\xe2\x80\x99 domain was now menaced with terrible danger. Evidently\r\n'b'the island, with its water, its harbor, its resources of all kinds so\r\n'b'increased in value by the colonists, and the concealment afforded by\r\n'b'Granite House, could not but be convenient for the convicts; in their\r\n'b'hands it would become an excellent place of refuge, and, being unknown,\r\n'b'it would assure them, for a long time perhaps, impunity and security.\r\n'b'Evidently, also, the lives of the settlers would not be respected, and\r\n'b'Bob Harvey and his accomplices\xe2\x80\x99 first care would be to massacre them\r\n'b'without mercy. Harding and his companions had, therefore, not even the\r\n'b'choice of flying and hiding themselves in the island, since the convicts\r\n'b'intended to reside there, and since, in the event of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' departing on an expedition, it was probable that some of the crew would\r\n'b'remain on shore, so as to settle themselves there. Therefore, it\r\n'b'would be necessary to fight, to destroy every one of these scoundrels,\r\n'b'unworthy of pity, and against whom any means would be right. So thought\r\n'b'Ayrton, and he well knew that Cyrus Harding would be of his way of\r\n'b'thinking.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But was resistance and, in the last place, victory possible? That would\r\n'b'depend on the equipment of the brig, and the number of men which she\r\n'b'carried.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This Ayrton resolved to learn at any cost, and as an hour after his\r\n'b'arrival the vociferations had begun to die away, and as a large number\r\n'b'of the convicts were already buried in a drunken sleep, Ayrton did not\r\n'b'hesitate to venture onto the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d deck, which the extinguished\r\n'b'lanterns now left in total darkness. He hoisted himself onto the\r\n'b'cutwater, and by the bowsprit arrived at the forecastle. Then, gliding\r\n'b'among the convicts stretched here and there, he made the round of the\r\n'b'ship, and found that the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d carried four guns, which would throw\r\n'b'shot of from eight to ten pounds in weight. He found also, on touching\r\n'b'them that these guns were breech-loaders. They were therefore, of modern\r\n'b'make, easily used, and of terrible effect.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the men lying on the deck, they were about ten in number, but\r\n'b'it was to be supposed that more were sleeping down below. Besides, by\r\n'b'listening to them, Ayrton had understood that there were fifty on\r\n'b'board. That was a large number for the six settlers of Lincoln Island to\r\n'b'contend with! But now, thanks to Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s devotion, Cyrus Harding would\r\n'b'not be surprised, he would know the strength of his adversaries, and\r\n'b'would make his arrangements accordingly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was nothing more for Ayrton to do but to return, and render to his\r\n'b'companions an account of the mission with which he had charged himself,\r\n'b'and he prepared to regain the bows of the brig, so that he might let\r\n'b'himself down into the water. But to this man, whose wish was, as he had\r\n'b'said, to do more than his duty, there came an heroic thought. This was\r\n'b'to sacrifice his own life, but save the island and the colonists. Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding evidently could not resist fifty ruffians, all well armed, who,\r\n'b'either by penetrating by main force into Granite House, or by starving\r\n'b'out the besieged, could obtain from them what they wanted. And then he\r\n'b'thought of his preservers--those who had made him again a man, and an\r\n'b'honest mm, those to whom he owed all--murdered without pity, their works\r\n'b'destroyed, their island turned into a pirates\xe2\x80\x99 den! He said to himself\r\n'b'that he, Ayrton, was the principal cause of so many disasters, since his\r\n'b'old companion, Bob Harvey, had but realized his own plans, and a\r\n'b'feeling of horror took possession of him. Then he was seized with an\r\n'b'irresistible desire to blow up the brig and with her, all whom she had\r\n'b'on board. He would perish in the explosion, but he would have done his\r\n'b'duty.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton did not hesitate. To reach the powder-room, which is always\r\n'b'situated in the after-part of a vessel, was easy. There would be no want\r\n'b'of powder in a vessel which followed such a trade, and a spark would be\r\n'b'enough to destroy it in an instant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton stole carefully along the between-decks, strewn with numerous\r\n'b'sleepers, overcome more by drunkenness than sleep. A lantern was lighted\r\n'b'at the foot of the mainmast, round which was hung a gun-rack, furnished\r\n'b'with weapons of all sorts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton took a revolver from the rack, and assured himself that it was\r\n'b'loaded and primed. Nothing more was needed to accomplish the work of\r\n'b'destruction. He then glided towards the stern, so as to arrive under the\r\n'b'brig\xe2\x80\x99s poop at the powder-magazine.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was difficult to proceed along the dimly lighted deck without\r\n'b'stumbling over some half-sleeping convict, who retorted by oaths and\r\n'b'kicks. Ayrton was, therefore, more than once obliged to halt. But at\r\n'b'last he arrived at the partition dividing the aftercabin, and found the\r\n'b'door opening into the magazine itself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton, compelled to force it open, set to work. It was a difficult\r\n'b'operation to perform without noise, for he had to break a padlock. But\r\n'b'under his vigorous hand, the padlock broke, and the door was open.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment a hand was laid on Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s shoulder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d asked a tall man, in a harsh voice, who,\r\n'b'standing in the shadow, quickly threw the light of a lantern in Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'face.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton drew back. In the rapid flash of the lantern, he had recognized\r\n'b'his former accomplice, Bob Harvey, who could not have known him, as he\r\n'b'must have thought Ayrton long since dead.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat are you doing here?\xe2\x80\x9d again said Bob Harvey, seizing Ayrton by the\r\n'b'waistband.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But Ayrton, without replying, wrenched himself from his grasp and\r\n'b'attempted to rush into the magazine. A shot fired into the midst of the\r\n'b'powder-casks, and all would be over!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHelp, lads!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Bob Harvey.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At his shout two or three pirates awoke, jumped up, and, rushing on\r\n'b'Ayrton, endeavored to throw him down. He soon extricated himself from\r\n'b'their grasp. He fired his revolver, and two of the convicts fell, but\r\n'b'a blow from a knife which he could not ward off made a gash in his\r\n'b'shoulder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton perceived that he could no longer hope to carry out his project.\r\n'b'Bob Harvey had reclosed the door of the powder-magazine, and a movement\r\n'b'on the deck indicated a general awakening of the pirates. Ayrton must\r\n'b'reserve himself to fight at the side of Cyrus Harding. There was nothing\r\n'b'for him but flight!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But was flight still possible? It was doubtful, yet Ayrton resolved to\r\n'b'dare everything in order to rejoin his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Four barrels of the revolver were still undischarged. Two were\r\n'b'fired--one, aimed at Bob Harvey, did not wound him, or at any rate\r\n'b'only slightly, and Ayrton, profiting by the momentary retreat of his\r\n'b'adversaries, rushed towards the companion-ladder to gain the deck.\r\n'b'Passing before the lantern, he smashed it with a blow from the butt of\r\n'b'his revolver. A profound darkness ensued, which favored his flight. Two\r\n'b'or three pirates, awakened by the noise, were descending the ladder at\r\n'b'the same moment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A fifth shot from Ayrton laid one low, and the others drew back, not\r\n'b'understanding what was going on. Ayrton was on deck in two bounds, and\r\n'b'three seconds later, having discharged his last barrel in the face of\r\n'b'a pirate who was about to seize him by the throat, he leaped over the\r\n'b'bulwarks into the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton had not made six strokes before shots were splashing around him\r\n'b'like hail.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What were Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s feelings, sheltered under a rock on the islet! What\r\n'b'were those of Harding, the reporter, Herbert, and Neb, crouched in the\r\n'b'Chimneys, when they heard the reports on board the brig! They rushed out\r\n'b'on to the beach, and, their guns shouldered, they stood ready to repel\r\n'b'any attack.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had no doubt about it themselves! Ayrton, surprised by the pirates,\r\n'b'had been murdered, and, perhaps, the wretches would profit by the night\r\n'b'to make a descent on the island!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Half an hour was passed in terrible anxiety. The firing had ceased, and\r\n'b'yet neither Ayrton nor Pencroft had reappeared. Was the islet invaded?\r\n'b'Ought they not to fly to the help of Ayrton and Pencroft? But how? The\r\n'b'tide being high at that time, rendered the channel impassable. The boat\r\n'b'was not there! We may imagine the horrible anxiety which took possession\r\n'b'of Harding and his companions!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last, towards half-past twelve, a boat, carrying two men, touched the\r\n'b'beach. It was Ayrton, slightly wounded in the shoulder, and Pencroft,\r\n'b'safe and sound, whom their friends received with open arms.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All immediately took refuge in the Chimneys. There Ayrton recounted all\r\n'b'that had passed, even to his plan for blowing up the brig, which he had\r\n'b'attempted to put into execution.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All hands were extended to Ayrton, who did not conceal from them that\r\n'b'their situation was serious. The pirates had been alarmed. They knew\r\n'b'that Lincoln Island was inhabited. They would land upon it in numbers\r\n'b'and well armed. They would respect nothing. Should the settlers fall\r\n'b'into their hands, they must expect no mercy!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we shall know how to die!\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go in and watch,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave we any chance of escape, captain?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHum! six against fifty!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! six! without counting--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus did not reply, but pointed upwards.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 3\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night passed without incident. The colonists were on the qui vive,\r\n'b'and did not leave their post at the Chimneys. The pirates, on their\r\n'b'side, did not appear to have made any attempt to land. Since the last\r\n'b'shots fired at Ayrton not a report, not even a sound, had betrayed the\r\n'b'presence of the brig in the neighborhood of the island. It might have\r\n'b'been fancied that she had weighed anchor, thinking that she had to deal\r\n'b'with her match, and had left the coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But it was no such thing, and when day began to dawn the settlers could\r\n'b'see a confused mass through the morning mist. It was the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9care the arrangements which\r\n'b'appear to me best to make before the fog completely clears away. It\r\n'b'hides us from the eyes of the pirates, and we can act without attracting\r\n'b'their attention. The most important thing is, that the convicts\r\n'b'should believe that the inhabitants of the island are numerous, and\r\n'b'consequently capable of resisting them. I therefore propose that we\r\n'b'divide into three parties. The first of which shall be posted at the\r\n'b'Chimneys, the second at the mouth of the Mercy. As to the third, I think\r\n'b'it would be best to place it on the islet, so as to prevent, or at all\r\n'b'events delay, any attempt at landing. We have the use of two rifles and\r\n'b'four muskets. Each of us will be armed, and, as we are amply provided\r\n'b'with powder and shot, we need not spare our fire. We have nothing to\r\n'b'fear from the muskets nor even from the guns of the brig. What can they\r\n'b'do against these rocks? And, as we shall not fire from the windows of\r\n'b'Granite House, the pirates will not think of causing irreparable damage\r\n'b'by throwing shell against it. What is to be feared is, the necessity of\r\n'b'meeting hand-to-hand, since the convicts have numbers on their side. We\r\n'b'must therefore try to prevent them from landing, but without discovering\r\n'b'ourselves. Therefore, do not economize the ammunition. Fire often, but\r\n'b'with a sure aim. We have each eight or ten enemies to kill, and they\r\n'b'must be killed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding had clearly represented their situation, although he spoke\r\n'b'in the calmest voice, as if it was a question of directing a piece\r\n'b'of work and not ordering a battle. His companions approved these\r\n'b'arrangements without even uttering a word. There was nothing more to be\r\n'b'done but for each to take his place before the fog should be completely\r\n'b'dissipated. Neb and Pencroft immediately ascended to Granite House and\r\n'b'brought back a sufficient quantity of ammunition. Gideon Spilett and\r\n'b'Ayrton, both very good marksmen, were armed with the two rifles,\r\n'b'which carried nearly a mile. The four other muskets were divided among\r\n'b'Harding, Neb, Pencroft, and Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The posts were arranged in the following manner:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Herbert remained in ambush at the Chimneys, thus\r\n'b'commanding the shore to the foot of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett and Neb crouched among the rocks at the mouth of the\r\n'b'Mercy, from which the drawbridges had been raised, so as to prevent any\r\n'b'one from crossing in a boat or landing on the opposite shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to Ayrton and Pencroft, they shoved off in the boat, and prepared to\r\n'b'cross the channel and to take up two separate stations on the islet.\r\n'b'In this way, shots being fired from four different points at once,\r\n'b'the convicts would be led to believe that the island was both largely\r\n'b'peopled and strongly defended.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the event of a landing being effected without their having been able\r\n'b'to prevent it, and also if they saw that they were on the point of being\r\n'b'cut off by the brig\xe2\x80\x99s boat, Ayrton and Pencroft were to return in their\r\n'b'boat to the shore and proceed towards the threatened spot.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Before starting to occupy their posts, the colonists for the last time\r\n'b'wrung each other\xe2\x80\x99s hands.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft succeeded in controlling himself sufficiently to suppress his\r\n'b'emotion when he embraced Herbert, his boy! and then they separated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few moments Harding and Herbert on one side, the reporter and Neb\r\n'b'on the other, had disappeared behind the rocks, and five minutes later\r\n'b'Ayrton and Pencroft, having without difficulty crossed the channel,\r\n'b'disembarked on the islet and concealed themselves in the clefts of its\r\n'b'eastern shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'None of them could have been seen, for they themselves could scarcely\r\n'b'distinguish the brig in the fog.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was half-past six in the morning.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Soon the fog began to clear away, and the topmasts of the brig issued\r\n'b'from the vapor. For some minutes great masses rolled over the surface of\r\n'b'the sea, then a breeze sprang up, which rapidly dispelled the mist.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d now appeared in full view, with a spring on her cable, her\r\n'b'head to the north, presenting her larboard side to the island. Just as\r\n'b'Harding had calculated, she was not more than a mile and a quarter from\r\n'b'the coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sinister black flag floated from the peak.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer, with his telescope, could see that the four guns on board\r\n'b'were pointed at the island. They were evidently ready to fire at a\r\n'b'moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d remained silent. About thirty pirates\r\n'b'could be seen moving on the deck. A few more on the poop; two others\r\n'b'posted in the shrouds, and armed with spyglasses, were attentively\r\n'b'surveying the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Certainly, Bob Harvey and his crew would not be able easily to give an\r\n'b'account of what had happened during the night on board the brig. Had\r\n'b'this half-naked man, who had forced the door of the powder-magazine, and\r\n'b'with whom they had struggled, who had six times discharged his revolver\r\n'b'at them, who had killed one and wounded two others, escaped their shot?\r\n'b'Had he been able to swim to shore? Whence did he come? What had been his\r\n'b'object? Had his design really been to blow up the brig, as Bob Harvey\r\n'b'had thought? All this must be confused enough to the convicts\xe2\x80\x99 minds.\r\n'b'But what they could no longer doubt was that the unknown island before\r\n'b'which the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d had cast anchor was inhabited, and that there was,\r\n'b'perhaps, a numerous colony ready to defend it. And yet no one was to be\r\n'b'seen, neither on the shore, nor on the heights. The beach appeared to be\r\n'b'absolutely deserted. At any rate, there was no trace of dwellings. Had\r\n'b'the inhabitants fled into the interior? Thus probably the pirate captain\r\n'b'reasoned, and doubtless, like a prudent man, he wished to reconnoiter\r\n'b'the locality before he allowed his men to venture there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During an hour and a half, no indication of attack or landing could be\r\n'b'observed on board the brig. Evidently Bob Harvey was hesitating. Even\r\n'b'with his strongest telescopes he could not have perceived one of the\r\n'b'settlers crouched among the rocks. It was not even probable that his\r\n'b'attention had been awakened by the screen of green branches and creepers\r\n'b'hiding the windows of Granite House, and showing rather conspicuously on\r\n'b'the bare rock. Indeed, how could he imagine that a dwelling was hollowed\r\n'b'out, at that height, in the solid granite? From Claw Cape to the\r\n'b'Mandible Capes, in all the extent of Union Bay, there was nothing to\r\n'b'lead him to suppose that the island was or could be inhabited.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock, however, the colonists observed a movement on board\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy.\xe2\x80\x9d A boat was lowered, and seven men jumped into her. They\r\n'b'were armed with muskets; one took the yoke-lines, four others the oars,\r\n'b'and the two others, kneeling in the bows, ready to fire, reconnoitered\r\n'b'the island. Their object was no doubt to make an examination but not to\r\n'b'land, for in the latter case they would have come in larger numbers. The\r\n'b'pirates from their look-out could have seen that the coast was sheltered\r\n'b'by an islet, separated from it by a channel half a mile in width.\r\n'b'However, it was soon evident to Cyrus Harding, on observing the\r\n'b'direction followed by the boat, that they would not attempt to penetrate\r\n'b'into the channel, but would land on the islet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Ayrton, each hidden in a narrow cleft of the rock, saw them\r\n'b'coming directly towards them, and waited till they were within range.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The boat advanced with extreme caution. The oars only dipped into the\r\n'b'water at long intervals. It could now be seen that one of the convicts\r\n'b'held a lead-line in his hand, and that he wished to fathom the depth of\r\n'b'the channel hollowed out by the current of the Mercy. This showed that\r\n'b'it was Bob Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s intention to bring his brig as near as possible\r\n'b'to the coast. About thirty pirates, scattered in the rigging, followed\r\n'b'every movement of the boat, and took the bearings of certain landmarks\r\n'b'which would allow them to approach without danger. The boat was not more\r\n'b'than two cables-lengths off the islet when she stopped. The man at the\r\n'b'tiller stood up and looked for the best place at which to land.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment two shots were heard. Smoke curled up from among the\r\n'b'rocks of the islet. The man at the helm and the man with the lead-line\r\n'b'fell backwards into the boat. Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s and Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s balls had struck\r\n'b'them both at the same moment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Almost immediately a louder report was heard, a cloud of smoke issued\r\n'b'from the brig\xe2\x80\x99s side, and a ball, striking the summit of the rock which\r\n'b'sheltered Ayrton and Pencroft, made it fly in splinters, but the two\r\n'b'marksmen remained unhurt.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Horrible imprecations burst from the boat, which immediately continued\r\n'b'its way. The man who had been at the tiller was replaced by one of his\r\n'b'comrades, and the oars were rapidly plunged into the water. However,\r\n'b'instead of returning on board as might have been expected, the boat\r\n'b'coasted along the islet, so as to round its southern point. The pirates\r\n'b'pulled vigorously at their oars that they might get out of range of the\r\n'b'bullets.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They advanced to within five cables-lengths of that part of the\r\n'b'shore terminated by Flotsam Point, and after having rounded it in a\r\n'b'semicircular line, still protected by the brig\xe2\x80\x99s guns, they proceeded\r\n'b'towards the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their evident intention was to penetrate into the channel, and cut off\r\n'b'the colonists posted on the islet, in such a way, that whatever their\r\n'b'number might be, being placed between the fire from the boat and the\r\n'b'fire from the brig, they would find themselves in a very disadvantageous\r\n'b'position.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A quarter of an hour passed while the boat advanced in this direction.\r\n'b'Absolute silence, perfect calm reigned in the air and on the water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Ayrton, although they knew they ran the risk of being\r\n'b'cut off, had not left their post, both that they did not wish to show\r\n'b'themselves as yet to their assailants, and expose themselves to the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d guns, and that they relied on Neb and Gideon Spilett,\r\n'b'watching at the mouth of the river, and on Cyrus Harding and Herbert, in\r\n'b'ambush among the rocks at the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Twenty minutes after the first shots were fired, the boat was less than\r\n'b'two cables-lengths off the Mercy. As the tide was beginning to rise with\r\n'b'its accustomed violence, caused by the narrowness of the straits, the\r\n'b'pirates were drawn towards the river, and it was only by dint of hard\r\n'b'rowing that they were able to keep in the middle of the channel. But, as\r\n'b'they were passing within good range of the mouth of the Mercy, two balls\r\n'b'saluted them, and two more of their number were laid in the bottom of\r\n'b'the boat. Neb and Spilett had not missed their aim.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The brig immediately sent a second ball on the post betrayed by the\r\n'b'smoke, but without any other result than that of splintering the rock.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The boat now contained only three able men. Carried on by the current,\r\n'b'it shot through the channel with the rapidity of an arrow, passed before\r\n'b'Harding and Herbert, who, not thinking it within range, withheld their\r\n'b'fire, then, rounding the northern point of the islet with the two\r\n'b'remaining oars, they pulled towards the brig.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Hitherto the settlers had nothing to complain of. Their adversaries\r\n'b'had certainly had the worst of it. The latter already counted four men\r\n'b'seriously wounded if not dead; they, on the contrary, unwounded, had not\r\n'b'missed a shot. If the pirates continued to attack them in this way, if\r\n'b'they renewed their attempt to land by means of a boat, they could be\r\n'b'destroyed one by one.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now seen how advantageous the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s arrangements had\r\n'b'been. The pirates would think that they had to deal with numerous and\r\n'b'well-armed adversaries, whom they could not easily get the better of.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Half an hour passed before the boat, having to pull against the current,\r\n'b'could get alongside the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy.\xe2\x80\x9d Frightful cries were heard when they\r\n'b'returned on board with the wounded, and two or three guns were fired\r\n'b'with no results.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But now about a dozen other convicts, maddened with rage, and possibly\r\n'b'by the effect of the evening\xe2\x80\x99s potations, threw themselves into the\r\n'b'boat. A second boat was also lowered, in which eight men took their\r\n'b'places, and while the first pulled straight for the islet, to dislodge\r\n'b'the colonists from thence the second maneuvered so as to force the\r\n'b'entrance of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The situation was evidently becoming very dangerous for Pencroft and\r\n'b'Ayrton, and they saw that they must regain the mainland.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, they waited till the first boat was within range, when two\r\n'b'well-directed balls threw its crew into disorder. Then, Pencroft and\r\n'b'Ayrton, abandoning their posts, under fire from the dozen muskets, ran\r\n'b'across the islet at full speed, jumped into their boat, crossed the\r\n'b'channel at the moment the second boat reached the southern end, and ran\r\n'b'to hide themselves in the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had scarcely rejoined Cyrus Harding and Herbert, before the islet\r\n'b'was overrun with pirates in every direction. Almost at the same moment,\r\n'b'fresh reports resounded from the Mercy station, to which the second boat\r\n'b'was rapidly approaching. Two, out of the eight men who manned her,\r\n'b'were mortally wounded by Gideon Spilett and Neb, and the boat herself,\r\n'b'carried irresistibly onto the reefs, was stove in at the mouth of the\r\n'b'Mercy. But the six survivors, holding their muskets above their heads to\r\n'b'preserve them from contact with the water, managed to land on the right\r\n'b'bank of the river. Then, finding they were exposed to the fire of the\r\n'b'ambush there, they fled in the direction of Flotsam Point, out of range\r\n'b'of the balls.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The actual situation was this: on the islet were a dozen convicts,\r\n'b'of whom some were no doubt wounded, but who had still a boat at their\r\n'b'disposal; on the island were six, but who could not by any possibility\r\n'b'reach Granite House, as they could not cross the river, all the bridges\r\n'b'being raised.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHallo,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft as he rushed into the Chimneys, \xe2\x80\x9challo,\r\n'b'captain! What do you think of it, now?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the combat will now take a new\r\n'b'form, for it cannot be supposed that the convicts will be so foolish as\r\n'b'to remain in a position so unfavorable for them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey won\xe2\x80\x99t cross the channel,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cAyrton and Mr.\r\n'b'Spilett\xe2\x80\x99s rifles are there to prevent them. You know that they carry\r\n'b'more than a mile!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert; \xe2\x80\x9cbut what can two rifles do against the\r\n'b'brig\xe2\x80\x99s guns?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the brig isn\xe2\x80\x99t in the channel yet, I fancy!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose she does come there?\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s impossible, for she would risk running aground and being lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ayrton. \xe2\x80\x9cThe convicts might profit by the high\r\n'b'tide to enter the channel, with the risk of grounding at low tide, it\r\n'b'is true; but then, under the fire from her guns, our posts would be no\r\n'b'longer tenable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cConfound them!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cit really seems as if the\r\n'b'blackguards were preparing to weigh anchor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps we shall be obliged to take refuge in Granite House!\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\n'b'Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must wait!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut Mr. Spilett and Neb?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey will know when it is best to rejoin us. Be ready, Ayrton. It is\r\n'b'yours and Spilett\xe2\x80\x99s rifles which must speak now.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was only too true. The \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d was beginning to weigh her anchor,\r\n'b'and her intention was evidently to approach the islet. The tide would\r\n'b'be rising for an hour and a half, and the ebb current being already\r\n'b'weakened, it would be easy for the brig to advance. But as to entering\r\n'b'the channel, Pencroft, contrary to Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, could not believe\r\n'b'that she would dare to attempt it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, the pirates who occupied the islet had gradually\r\n'b'advanced to the opposite shore, and were now only separated from the\r\n'b'mainland by the channel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Being armed with muskets alone, they could do no harm to the settlers,\r\n'b'in ambush at the Chimneys and the mouth of the Mercy; but, not knowing\r\n'b'the latter to be supplied with long-range rifles, they on their side did\r\n'b'not believe themselves to be exposed. Quite uncovered, therefore, they\r\n'b'surveyed the islet, and examined the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their illusion was of short duration. Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s and Gideon Spilett\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'rifles then spoke, and no doubt imparted some very disagreeable\r\n'b'intelligence to two of the convicts, for they fell backwards.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then there was a general helter-skelter. The ten others, not even\r\n'b'stopping to pick up their dead or wounded companions, fled to the other\r\n'b'side of the islet, tumbled into the boat which had brought them, and\r\n'b'pulled away with all their strength.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEight less!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cReally, one would have thought that\r\n'b'Mr. Spilett and Ayrton had given the word to fire together!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ayrton, as he reloaded his gun, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is becoming more\r\n'b'serious. The brig is making sail!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe anchor is weighed!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and she is already moving.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, they could distinctly hear the creaking of the windlass. The\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d was at first held by her anchor; then, when that had been\r\n'b'raised, she began to drift towards the shore. The wind was blowing\r\n'b'from the sea; the jib and the foretopsail were hoisted, and the vessel\r\n'b'gradually approached the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From the two posts of the Mercy and the Chimneys they watched her\r\n'b'without giving a sign of life, but not without some emotion. What\r\n'b'could be more terrible for the colonists than to be exposed, at a short\r\n'b'distance, to the brig\xe2\x80\x99s guns, without being able to reply with any\r\n'b'effect? How could they then prevent the pirates from landing?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding felt this strongly, and he asked himself what it would\r\n'b'be possible to do. Before long, he would be called upon for his\r\n'b'determination. But what was it to be? To shut themselves up in Granite\r\n'b'House, to be besieged there, to remain there for weeks, for months even,\r\n'b'since they had an abundance of provisions? So far good! But after that?\r\n'b'The pirates would not the less be masters of the island, which they\r\n'b'would ravage at their pleasure, and in time, they would end by having\r\n'b'their revenge on the prisoners in Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, one chance yet remained; it was that Bob Harvey, after all,\r\n'b'would not venture his ship into the channel, and that he would keep\r\n'b'outside the islet. He would be still separated from the coast by half a\r\n'b'mile, and at that distance his shot could not be very destructive.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cBob Harvey will never, if he is a good\r\n'b'seaman, enter that channel! He knows well that it would risk the brig,\r\n'b'if the sea got up ever so little! And what would become of him without\r\n'b'his vessel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile the brig approached the islet, and it could be seen\r\n'b'that she was endeavoring to make the lower end. The breeze was light,\r\n'b'and as the current had then lost much of its force, Bob Harvey had\r\n'b'absolute command over his vessel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The route previously followed by the boats had allowed her to\r\n'b'reconnoiter the channel, and she boldly entered it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The pirate\xe2\x80\x99s design was now only too evident; he wished to bring her\r\n'b'broadside to bear on the Chimneys and from there to reply with shell and\r\n'b'ball to the shot which had till then decimated her crew.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Soon the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d reached the point of the islet; she rounded it with\r\n'b'ease; the mainsail was braced up, and the brig hugging the wind, stood\r\n'b'across the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe scoundrels! they are coming!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment, Cyrus Harding, Ayrton, the sailor, and Herbert, were\r\n'b'rejoined by Neb and Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter and his companion had judged it best to abandon the post at\r\n'b'the Mercy, from which they could do nothing against the ship, and they\r\n'b'had acted wisely. It was better that the colonists should be together at\r\n'b'the moment when they were about to engage in a decisive action. Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett and Neb had arrived by dodging behind the rocks, though not\r\n'b'without attracting a shower of bullets, which had not, however, reached\r\n'b'them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpilett! Neb!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are not wounded?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9ca few bruises only from the ricochet! But\r\n'b'that cursed brig has entered the channel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand in ten minutes she will have anchored\r\n'b'before Granite House!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave you formed any plan, Cyrus?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must take refuge in Granite House while there is still time, and the\r\n'b'convicts cannot see us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is, my opinion, too,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut once shut up--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must be guided by circumstances,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us be off, then, and make haste!\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWould you not wish, captain, that Ayrton and I should remain here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' asked the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat would be the use of that, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cNo. We will\r\n'b'not separate!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was not a moment to be lost. The colonists left the Chimneys. A\r\n'b'bend of the cliff prevented them from being seen by those in the brig,\r\n'b'but two or three reports, and the crash of bullets on the rock, told\r\n'b'them that the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d was at no great distance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To spring into the lift, hoist themselves up to the door of Granite\r\n'b'House, where Top and Jup had been shut up since the evening before, to\r\n'b'rush into the large room, was the work of a minute only.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was quite time, for the settlers, through the branches, could see the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy,\xe2\x80\x9d surrounded with smoke, gliding up the channel. The firing was\r\n'b'incessant, and shot from the four guns struck blindly, both on the Mercy\r\n'b'post, although it was not occupied, and on the Chimneys. The rocks were\r\n'b'splintered, and cheers accompanied each discharge. However, they\r\n'b'were hoping that Granite House would be spared, thanks to Harding\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'precaution of concealing the windows when a shot, piercing the door,\r\n'b'penetrated into the passage.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are discovered!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists had not, perhaps, been seen, but it was certain that Bob\r\n'b'Harvey had thought proper to send a ball through the suspected foliage\r\n'b'which concealed that part of the cliff. Soon he redoubled his attack,\r\n'b'when another ball having torn away the leafy screen, disclosed a gaping\r\n'b'aperture in the granite.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists\xe2\x80\x99 situation was desperate. Their retreat was discovered.\r\n'b'They could not oppose any obstacle to these missiles, nor protect the\r\n'b'stone, which flew in splinters around them. There was nothing to be\r\n'b'done but to take refuge in the upper passage of Granite House, and leave\r\n'b'their dwelling to be devastated, when a deep roar was heard, followed by\r\n'b'frightful cries!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions rushed to one of the windows--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The brig, irresistibly raised on a sort of water-spout, had just split\r\n'b'in two, and in less than ten seconds she was swallowed up with all her\r\n'b'criminal crew!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 4\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShe has blown up!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! blown up, just as if Ayrton had set fire to the powder!\xe2\x80\x9d returned\r\n'b'Pencroft, throwing himself into the lift together with Neb and the lad.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what has happened?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett, quite stunned by this\r\n'b'unexpected catastrophe.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh! this time, we shall know--\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer quickly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat shall we know?--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLater! later! Come, Spilett. The main point is that these pirates have\r\n'b'been exterminated!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Cyrus Harding, hurrying away the reporter and Ayrton, joined\r\n'b'Pencroft, Neb, and Herbert on the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nothing could be seen of the brig, not even her masts. After having been\r\n'b'raised by the water-spout, she had fallen on her side, and had sunk in\r\n'b'that position, doubtless in consequence of some enormous leak. But as\r\n'b'in that place the channel was not more than twenty feet in depth, it\r\n'b'was certain that the sides of the submerged brig would reappear at low\r\n'b'water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few things from the wreck floated on the surface of the water, a raft\r\n'b'could be seen consisting of spare spars, coops of poultry with their\r\n'b'occupants still living, boxes and barrels, which gradually came to the\r\n'b'surface, after having escaped through the hatchways, but no pieces of\r\n'b'the wreck appeared, neither planks from the deck, nor timber from the\r\n'b'hull,--which rendered the sudden disappearance of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d perfectly\r\n'b'inexplicable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the two masts, which had been broken and escaped from the\r\n'b'shrouds and stays came up, and with their sails, some furled and the\r\n'b'others spread. But it was not necessary to wait for the tide to bring\r\n'b'up these riches, and Ayrton and Pencroft jumped into the boat with the\r\n'b'intention of towing the pieces of wreck either to the beach or to the\r\n'b'islet. But just as they were shoving off, an observation from Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett arrested them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat about those six convicts who disembarked on the right bank of the\r\n'b'Mercy?\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, it would not do to forget that the six men whose boat had gone\r\n'b'to pieces on the rocks had landed at Flotsam Point.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They looked in that direction. None of the fugitives were visible. It\r\n'b'was probable that, having seen their vessel engulfed in the channel,\r\n'b'they had fled into the interior of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will deal with them later,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cAs they are armed, they\r\n'b'will still be dangerous; but as it is six against six, the chances are\r\n'b'equal. To the most pressing business first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton and Pencroft pulled vigorously towards the wreck.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sea was calm and the tide very high, as there had been a new moon\r\n'b'but two days before. A whole hour at least would elapse before the hull\r\n'b'of the brig could emerge from the water of the channel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton and Pencroft were able to fasten the masts and spars by means of\r\n'b'ropes, the ends of which were carried to the beach. There, by the united\r\n'b'efforts of the settlers the pieces of wreck were hauled up. Then the\r\n'b'boat picked up all that was floating, coops, barrels, and boxes, which\r\n'b'were immediately carried to the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Several bodies floated also. Among them, Ayrton recognized that of\r\n'b'Bob Harvey, which he pointed out to his companion, saying with some\r\n'b'emotion,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is what I have been, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what you are no longer, brave Ayrton!\xe2\x80\x9d returned the sailor warmly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was singular enough that so few bodies floated. Only five or six were\r\n'b'counted, which were already being carried by the current towards the\r\n'b'open sea. Very probably the convicts had not had time to escape, and\r\n'b'the ship lying over on her side, the greater number of them had remained\r\n'b'below. Now the current, by carrying the bodies of these miserable men\r\n'b'out to sea, would spare the colonists the sad task of burying them in\r\n'b'some corner of their island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For two hours, Cyrus Harding and his companions were solely occupied\r\n'b'in hauling up the spars on to the sand, and then in spreading the sails\r\n'b'which were perfectly uninjured, to dry. They spoke little, for they were\r\n'b'absorbed in their work, but what thoughts occupied their minds!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The possession of this brig, or rather all that she contained, was\r\n'b'a perfect mine of wealth. In fact, a ship is like a little world in\r\n'b'miniature, and the stores of the colony would be increased by a large\r\n'b'number of useful articles. It would be, on a large scale, equivalent to\r\n'b'the chest found at Flotsam Point.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd besides,\xe2\x80\x9d thought Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy should it be impossible to refloat\r\n'b'the brig? If she has only a leak, that may be stopped up; a vessel from\r\n'b'three to four hundred tons, why she is a regular ship compared to our\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99! And we could go a long distance in her! We could go\r\n'b'anywhere we liked! Captain Harding, Ayrton and I must examine her! She\r\n'b'would be well worth the trouble!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, if the brig was still fit to navigate, the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 chances\r\n'b'of returning to their native land were singularly increased. But, to\r\n'b'decide this important question, it was necessary to wait until the tide\r\n'b'was quite low, so that every part of the brig\xe2\x80\x99s hull might be examined.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When their treasures had been safely conveyed on shore, Harding and his\r\n'b'companions agreed to devote some minutes to breakfast. They were almost\r\n'b'famished; fortunately, the larder was not far off, and Neb was noted\r\n'b'for being an expeditious cook. They breakfasted, therefore, near the\r\n'b'Chimneys, and during their repast, as may be supposed, nothing was\r\n'b'talked of but the event which had so miraculously saved the colony.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMiraculous is the word,\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cfor it must be\r\n'b'acknowledged that those rascals blew up just at the right moment!\r\n'b'Granite House was beginning to be uncomfortable as a habitation!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd can you guess, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9chow it happened, or\r\n'b'what can have occasioned the explosion?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh! Mr. Spilett, nothing is more simple,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cA convict\r\n'b'vessel is not disciplined like a man-of-war! Convicts are not sailors.\r\n'b'Of course the powder-magazine was open, and as they were firing\r\n'b'incessantly, some careless or clumsy fellow just blew up the vessel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat astonishes me is that the\r\n'b'explosion has not produced more effect. The report was not loud, and\r\n'b'besides there are so few planks and timbers torn out. It seems as if the\r\n'b'ship had rather foundered than blown up.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDoes that astonish you, my boy?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, captain.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it astonishes me also, Herbert,\xe2\x80\x9d replied he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut when we visit the\r\n'b'hull of the brig, we shall no doubt find the explanation of the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cyou don\xe2\x80\x99t suppose that the \xe2\x80\x98Speedy\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'simply foundered like a ship which has struck on a rock?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy not,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cif there are rocks in the channel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cyou did not look at the right\r\n'b'moment. An instant before she sank, the brig, as I saw perfectly well,\r\n'b'rose on an enormous wave, and fell back on her larboard side. Now, if\r\n'b'she had only struck, she would have sunk quietly and gone to the bottom\r\n'b'like an honest vessel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was just because she was not an honest vessel!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, we shall soon see, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall soon see,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I would wager my\r\n'b'head there are no rocks in the channel. Look here, captain, to speak\r\n'b'candidly, do you mean to say that there is anything marvelous in the\r\n'b'occurrence?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding did not answer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether rock or explosion, you will\r\n'b'agree, Pencroft, that it occurred just in the nick of time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! yes!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is not the question. I ask\r\n'b'Captain Harding if he sees anything supernatural in all this.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI cannot say, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cThat is all the answer I\r\n'b'can make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A reply which did not satisfy Pencroft at all. He stuck to \xe2\x80\x9can\r\n'b'explosion,\xe2\x80\x9d and did not wish to give it up. He would never consent\r\n'b'to admit that in that channel, with its fine sandy bed, just like\r\n'b'the beach, which he had often crossed at low water, there could be an\r\n'b'unknown rock.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And besides, at the time the brig foundered, it was high water, that is\r\n'b'to say, there was enough water to carry the vessel clear over any rocks\r\n'b'which would not be uncovered at low tide. Therefore, there could not\r\n'b'have been a collision. Therefore, the vessel had not struck. So she had\r\n'b'blown up.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And it must be confessed that the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s arguments were reasonable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards half-past one, the colonists embarked in the boat to visit the\r\n'b'wreck. It was to be regretted that the brig\xe2\x80\x99s two boats had not been\r\n'b'saved; but one, as has been said, had gone to pieces at the mouth of the\r\n'b'Mercy, and was absolutely useless; the other had disappeared when the\r\n'b'brig went down, and had not again been seen, having doubtless been\r\n'b'crushed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The hull of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d was just beginning to issue from the water.\r\n'b'The brig was lying right over on her side, for her masts being broken,\r\n'b'pressed down by the weight of the ballast displaced by the shock, the\r\n'b'keel was visible along her whole length. She had been regularly turned\r\n'b'over by the inexplicable but frightful submarine action, which had been\r\n'b'at the same time manifested by an enormous water-spout.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers rowed round the hull, and in proportion as the tide went\r\n'b'down, they could ascertain, if not the cause which had occasioned the\r\n'b'catastrophe, at least the effect produced.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards the bows, on both sides of the keel, seven or eight feet from\r\n'b'the beginning of the stem, the sides of the brig were frightfully torn.\r\n'b'Over a length of at least twenty feet there opened two large leaks,\r\n'b'which would be impossible to stop up. Not only had the copper sheathing\r\n'b'and the planks disappeared, reduced, no doubt, to powder, but also the\r\n'b'ribs, the iron bolts, and treenails which united them. From the entire\r\n'b'length of the hull to the stern the false keel had been separated with\r\n'b'an unaccountable violence, and the keel itself, torn from the carline in\r\n'b'several places, was split in all its length.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ve a notion!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this vessel will be difficult\r\n'b'to get afloat again.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt will be impossible,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett to the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthe explosion,\r\n'b'if there has been one, has produced singular effects! It has split the\r\n'b'lower part of the hull, instead of blowing up the deck and topsides!\r\n'b'These great rents appear rather to have been made by a rock than by the\r\n'b'explosion of a powder-magazine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere is not a rock in the channel!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cI will admit\r\n'b'anything you like, except the rock.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try to penetrate into the interior of the brig,\xe2\x80\x9d said the\r\n'b'engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps we shall then know what to think of the cause of her\r\n'b'destruction.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was the best thing to be done, and it was agreed, besides, to\r\n'b'take an inventory of all the treasures on board, and to arrange their\r\n'b'preservation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Access to the interior of the brig was now easy. The tide was still\r\n'b'going down and the deck was practicable. The ballast, composed of heavy\r\n'b'masses of iron, had broken through in several places. The noise of the\r\n'b'sea could be heard as it rushed out at the holes in the hull.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions, hatchets in hand, advanced along the\r\n'b'shattered deck. Cases of all sorts encumbered it, and, as they had\r\n'b'been but a very short time in the water, their contents were perhaps\r\n'b'uninjured.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They then busied themselves in placing all this cargo in safety. The\r\n'b'water would not return for several hours, and these hours must be\r\n'b'employed in the most profitable way. Ayrton and Pencroft had, at the\r\n'b'entrance made in the hull, discovered tackle, which would serve to hoist\r\n'b'up the barrels and chests. The boat received them and transported them\r\n'b'to the shore. They took the articles as they came, intending to sort\r\n'b'them afterwards.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At any rate, the settlers saw at once, with extreme satisfaction, that\r\n'b'the brig possessed a very varied cargo--an assortment of all sorts of\r\n'b'articles, utensils, manufactured goods, and tools--such as the ships\r\n'b'which make the great coasting-trade of Polynesia are usually laden with.\r\n'b'It was probable that they would find a little of everything, and they\r\n'b'agreed that it was exactly what was necessary for the colony of Lincoln\r\n'b'Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However--and Cyrus Harding observed it in silent astonishment--not only,\r\n'b'as has been said, had the hull of the brig enormously suffered from the\r\n'b'shock, whatever it was, that had occasioned the catastrophe, but the\r\n'b'interior arrangements had been destroyed, especially towards the bows.\r\n'b'Partitions and stanchions were smashed, as if some tremendous shell had\r\n'b'burst in the interior of the brig. The colonists could easily go fore\r\n'b'and aft, after having removed the cases as they were extricated. They\r\n'b'were not heavy bales, which would have been difficult to remove,\r\n'b'but simple packages, of which the stowage, besides, was no longer\r\n'b'recognizable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists then reached the stern of the brig--the part formerly\r\n'b'surmounted by the poop. It was there that, following Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'directions, they must look for the powder-magazine. Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'thought that it had not exploded; that it was possible some barrels\r\n'b'might be saved, and that the powder, which is usually enclosed in metal\r\n'b'coverings might not have suffered from contact with the water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This, in fact, was just what had happened. They extricated from among\r\n'b'a large number of shot twenty barrels, the insides of which were lined\r\n'b'with copper. Pencroft was convinced by the evidence of his own eyes that\r\n'b'the destruction of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d could not be attributed to an explosion.\r\n'b'That part of the hull in which the magazine was situated was, moreover,\r\n'b'that which had suffered least.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d said the obstinate sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cbut as to a rock, there is\r\n'b'not one in the channel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, how did it happen?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI don\xe2\x80\x99t know,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding doesn\xe2\x80\x99t know, and\r\n'b'nobody knows or ever will know!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Several hours had passed during these researches, and the tide began to\r\n'b'flow. Work must be suspended for the present. There was no fear of the\r\n'b'brig being carried away by the sea, for she was already fixed as firmly\r\n'b'as if moored by her anchors.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They could, therefore, without inconvenience, wait until the next day to\r\n'b'resume operations; but, as to the vessel itself, she was doomed, and it\r\n'b'would be best to hasten to save the remains of her hull, as she would\r\n'b'not be long in disappearing in the quicksands of the channel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now five o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening. It had been a hard day\xe2\x80\x99s work\r\n'b'for the men. They ate with good appetite, and notwithstanding their\r\n'b'fatigue, they could not resist, after dinner, their desire of inspecting\r\n'b'the cases which composed the cargo of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Most of them contained clothes, which, as may be believed, was well\r\n'b'received. There were enough to clothe a whole colony--linen for every\r\n'b'one\xe2\x80\x99s use, shoes for every one\xe2\x80\x99s feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe are too rich!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cBut what are we going to do with\r\n'b'all this?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And every moment burst forth the hurrahs of the delighted sailor when he\r\n'b'caught sight of the barrels of gunpowder, firearms and sidearms,\r\n'b'balls of cotton, implements of husbandry, carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s, joiner\xe2\x80\x99s, and\r\n'b'blacksmith\xe2\x80\x99s tools, and boxes of all kinds of seeds, not in the least\r\n'b'injured by their short sojourn in the water. Ah, two years before,\r\n'b'how these things would have been prized! And now, even though the\r\n'b'industrious colonists had provided themselves with tools, these\r\n'b'treasures would find their use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no want of space in the store-rooms of Granite House, but that\r\n'b'daytime would not allow them to stow away the whole. It would not do\r\n'b'also to forget that the six survivors of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d crew had landed\r\n'b'on the island, for they were in all probability scoundrels of the\r\n'b'deepest dye, and it was necessary that the colonists should be on their\r\n'b'guard against them. Although the bridges over the Mercy were raised,\r\n'b'the convicts would not be stopped by a river or a stream and, rendered\r\n'b'desperate, these wretches would be capable of anything.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They would see later what plan it would be best to follow; but in the\r\n'b'meantime it was necessary to mount guard over cases and packages heaped\r\n'b'up near the Chimneys, and thus the settlers employed themselves in turn\r\n'b'during the night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The morning came, however, without the convicts having attempted any\r\n'b'attack. Master Jup and Top, on guard at the foot of Granite House, would\r\n'b'have quickly given the alarm. The three following days--the 19th, 20th,\r\n'b'and 21st of October--were employed in saving everything of value, or of\r\n'b'any use whatever, either from the cargo or rigging of the brig. At low\r\n'b'tide they overhauled the hold--at high tide they stowed away the rescued\r\n'b'articles. A great part of the copper sheathing had been torn from the\r\n'b'hull, which every day sank lower. But before the sand had swallowed the\r\n'b'heavy things which had fallen through the bottom, Ayrton and Pencroft,\r\n'b'diving to the bed of the channel, recovered the chains and anchors of\r\n'b'the brig, the iron of her ballast, and even four guns, which, floated by\r\n'b'means of empty casks, were brought to shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It may be seen that the arsenal of the colony had gained by the\r\n'b'wreck, as well as the storerooms of Granite House. Pencroft, always\r\n'b'enthusiastic in his projects, already spoke of constructing a battery\r\n'b'to command the channel and the mouth of the river. With four guns,\r\n'b'he engaged to prevent any fleet, \xe2\x80\x9chowever powerful it might be,\xe2\x80\x9d from\r\n'b'venturing into the waters of Lincoln Island!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meantime, when nothing remained of the brig but a useless hulk,\r\n'b'bad weather came on, which soon finished her. Cyrus Harding had intended\r\n'b'to blow her up, so as to collect the remains on the shore, but a strong\r\n'b'gale from the northeast and a heavy sea compelled him to economize his\r\n'b'powder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, on the night of the 23rd, the hull entirely broke up, and some\r\n'b'of the wreck was cast up on the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the papers on board, it is useless to say that, although he\r\n'b'carefully searched the lockers of the poop, Harding did not discover\r\n'b'any trace of them. The pirates had evidently destroyed everything that\r\n'b'concerned either the captain or the owners of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy,\xe2\x80\x9d and, as the\r\n'b'name of her port was not painted on her counter, there was nothing which\r\n'b'would tell them her nationality. However, by the shape of her boats\r\n'b'Ayrton and Pencroft believed that the brig was of English build.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A week after the castrophe--or, rather, after the fortunate, though\r\n'b'inexplicable, event to which the colony owed its preservation--nothing\r\n'b'more could be seen of the vessel, even at low tide. The wreck had\r\n'b'disappeared, and Granite House was enriched by nearly all it had\r\n'b'contained.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the mystery which enveloped its strange destruction would\r\n'b'doubtless never have been cleared away if, on the 30th of November, Neb,\r\n'b'strolling on the beach, had not found a piece of a thick iron cylinder,\r\n'b'bearing traces of explosion. The edges of this cylinder were twisted and\r\n'b'broken, as if they had been subjected to the action of some explosive\r\n'b'substance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb brought this piece of metal to his master, who was then occupied\r\n'b'with his companions in the workshop of the Chimneys.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding examined the cylinder attentively, then, turning to\r\n'b'Pencroft,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou persist, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cin maintaining that the \xe2\x80\x98Speedy\xe2\x80\x99 was\r\n'b'not lost in consequence of a collision?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cYou know as well as I do that\r\n'b'there are no rocks in the channel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose she had run against this piece of iron?\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer,\r\n'b'showing the broken cylinder.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, that bit of pipe!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft in a tone of perfect\r\n'b'incredulity.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cyou remember that before she foundered\r\n'b'the brig rose on the summit of a regular waterspout?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, would you like to know what occasioned that waterspout? It was\r\n'b'this,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, holding up the broken tube.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! This cylinder is all that remains of a torpedo!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA torpedo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who put the torpedo there?\xe2\x80\x9d demanded Pencroft, who did not like to\r\n'b'yield.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll that I can tell you is, that it was not I,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding;\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cbut it was there, and you have been able to judge of its incomparable\r\n'b'power!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 5\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So, then, all was explained by the submarine explosion of this torpedo.\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding could not be mistaken, as, during the war of the Union,\r\n'b'he had had occasion to try these terrible engines of destruction. It\r\n'b'was under the action of this cylinder, charged with some explosive\r\n'b'substance, nitro-glycerine, picrate, or some other material of the same\r\n'b'nature, that the water of the channel had been raised like a dome, the\r\n'b'bottom of the brig crushed in, and she had sunk instantly, the damage\r\n'b'done to her hull being so considerable that it was impossible to refloat\r\n'b'her. The \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d had not been able to withstand a torpedo that would\r\n'b'have destroyed an ironclad as easily as a fishing-boat!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Yes! all was explained, everything--except the presence of the torpedo\r\n'b'in the waters of the channel!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwe can no longer be in doubt\r\n'b'as to the presence of a mysterious being, a castaway like us, perhaps,\r\n'b'abandoned on our island, and I say this in order that Ayrton may be\r\n'b'acquainted with all the strange events which have occurred during these\r\n'b'two years. Who this beneficent stranger is, whose intervention has, so\r\n'b'fortunately for us, been manifested on many occasions, I cannot imagine.\r\n'b'What his object can be in acting thus, in concealing himself after\r\n'b'rendering us so many services, I cannot understand: But his services are\r\n'b'not the less real, and are of such a nature that only a man possessed of\r\n'b'prodigious power, could render them. Ayrton is indebted to him as much\r\n'b'as we are, for, if it was the stranger who saved me from the waves after\r\n'b'the fall from the balloon, evidently it was he who wrote the document,\r\n'b'who placed the bottle in the channel, and who has made known to us the\r\n'b'situation of our companion. I will add that it was he who guided that\r\n'b'chest, provided with everything we wanted, and stranded it on Flotsam\r\n'b'Point; that it was he who lighted that fire on the heights of the\r\n'b'island, which permitted you to land; that it was he who fired that\r\n'b'bullet found in the body of the peccary; that it was he who plunged that\r\n'b'torpedo into the channel, which destroyed the brig; in a word, that all\r\n'b'those inexplicable events, for which we could not assign a reason, are\r\n'b'due to this mysterious being. Therefore, whoever he may be, whether\r\n'b'shipwrecked, or exiled on our island, we shall be ungrateful, if we\r\n'b'think ourselves freed from gratitude towards him. We have contracted a\r\n'b'debt, and I hope that we shall one day pay it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right in speaking thus, my dear Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, there is an almost all-powerful being, hidden in some part of the\r\n'b'island, and whose influence has been singularly useful to our colony.\r\n'b'I will add that the unknown appears to possess means of action which\r\n'b'border on the supernatural, if in the events of practical life the\r\n'b'supernatural were recognizable. Is it he who is in secret communication\r\n'b'with us by the well in Granite House, and has he thus a knowledge of all\r\n'b'our plans? Was it he who threw us that bottle, when the vessel made her\r\n'b'first cruise? Was it he who threw Top out of the lake, and killed the\r\n'b'dugong? Was it he, who as everything leads us to believe, saved you from\r\n'b'the waves, and that under circumstances in which any one else would not\r\n'b'have been able to act? If it was he, he possesses a power which renders\r\n'b'him master of the elements.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning was just, and every one felt it to be so.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cif the intervention of a human being is\r\n'b'not more questionable for us, I agree that he has at his disposal means\r\n'b'of action beyond those possessed by humanity. There is a mystery still,\r\n'b'but if we discover the man, the mystery will be discovered also. The\r\n'b'question, then, is, ought we to respect the incognito of this generous\r\n'b'being, or ought we to do everything to find him out? What is your\r\n'b'opinion on the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cis that, whoever he may be, he is a brave\r\n'b'man, and he has my esteem!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBe it so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is not an answer, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaster,\xe2\x80\x9d then said Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cmy idea is, that we may search as long as we\r\n'b'like for this gentleman whom you are talking about, but that we shall\r\n'b'not discover him till he pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s not bad, what you say, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am of Neb\xe2\x80\x99s opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is no reason for\r\n'b'not attempting the adventure. Whether we find this mysterious being or\r\n'b'not, we shall at least have fulfilled our duty towards him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, my boy, give us your opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, turning to\r\n'b'Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, his countenance full of animation, \xe2\x80\x9chow I should\r\n'b'like to thank him, he who saved you first, and who has now saved us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOf course, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cso would I and all of us. I am\r\n'b'not inquisitive, but I would give one of my eyes to see this individual\r\n'b'face to face! It seems to me that he must be handsome, tall, strong,\r\n'b'with a splendid beard, radiant hair, and that he must be seated on\r\n'b'clouds, a great ball in his hands!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are describing a picture of the\r\n'b'Creator.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPossibly, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut that is how I imagine\r\n'b'him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Ayrton?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ayrton, \xe2\x80\x9cI can give you no better advice in\r\n'b'this matter. Whatever you do will be best; when you wish me to join you\r\n'b'in your researches, I am ready to follow you.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI thank you, Ayrton,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I should like a more\r\n'b'direct answer to the question I put to you. You are our companion; you\r\n'b'have already endangered your life several times for us, and you, as\r\n'b'well as the rest, ought to be consulted in the matter of any important\r\n'b'decision. Speak, therefore.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ayrton, \xe2\x80\x9cI think that we ought to do\r\n'b'everything to discover this unknown benefactor. Perhaps he is alone.\r\n'b'Perhaps he is suffering. Perhaps he has a life to be renewed. I, too,\r\n'b'as you said, have a debt of gratitude to pay him. It was he, it could be\r\n'b'only he who must have come to Tabor Island, who found there the wretch\r\n'b'you knew, and who made known to you that there was an unfortunate man\r\n'b'there to be saved. Therefore it is, thanks to him, that I have become a\r\n'b'man again. No, I will never forget him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is settled, then,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cWe will begin our\r\n'b'researches as soon as possible. We will not leave a corner of the island\r\n'b'unexplored. We will search into its most secret recesses, and will\r\n'b'hope that our unknown friend will pardon us in consideration of our\r\n'b'intentions!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For several days the colonists were actively employed in haymaking and\r\n'b'the harvest. Before putting their project of exploring the yet unknown\r\n'b'parts of the island into execution, they wished to get all possible work\r\n'b'finished. It was also the time for collecting the various vegetables\r\n'b'from the Tabor Island plants. All was stowed away, and happily there was\r\n'b'no want of room in Granite House, in which they might have housed all\r\n'b'the treasures of the island. The products of the colony were there,\r\n'b'methodically arranged, and in a safe place, as may be believed,\r\n'b'sheltered as much from animals as from man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no fear of damp in the middle of that thick mass of granite.\r\n'b'Many natural excavations situated in the upper passage were enlarged\r\n'b'either by pick-axe or mine, and Granite House thus became a general\r\n'b'warehouse, containing all the provisions, arms, tools, and spare\r\n'b'utensils--in a word, all the stores of the colony.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the guns obtained from the brig, they were pretty pieces of\r\n'b'ordnance, which, at Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s entreaty, were hoisted by means of tackle\r\n'b'and pulleys, right up into Granite House; embrasures were made between\r\n'b'the windows, and the shining muzzles of the guns could soon be seen\r\n'b'through the granite cliff. From this height they commanded all Union\r\n'b'Bay. It was like a little Gibraltar, and any vessel anchored off the\r\n'b'islet would inevitably be exposed to the fire of this aerial battery.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft one day, it was the 8th of November, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that\r\n'b'our fortifications are finished, it would be a good thing if we tried\r\n'b'the range of our guns.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you think that is useful?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is more than useful, it is necessary! Without that how are we to\r\n'b'know to what distance we can send one of those pretty shot with which we\r\n'b'are provided?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTry them, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I think that in\r\n'b'making the experiment, we ought to employ, not the ordinary powder,\r\n'b'the supply of which, I think, should remain untouched, but the pyroxyle\r\n'b'which will never fail us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCan the cannon support the shock of the pyroxyle?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter,\r\n'b'who was not less anxious than Pencroft to try the artillery of Granite\r\n'b'House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI believe so. However,\xe2\x80\x9d added the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will be prudent.\xe2\x80\x9d The\r\n'b'engineer was right in thinking that the guns were of excellent make.\r\n'b'Made of forged steel, and breech-loaders, they ought consequently to be\r\n'b'able to bear a considerable charge, and also have an enormous range.\r\n'b'In fact, as regards practical effect, the transit described by the ball\r\n'b'ought to be as extended as possible, and this tension could only be\r\n'b'obtained under the condition that the projectile should be impelled with\r\n'b'a very great initial velocity.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding to his companions, \xe2\x80\x9cthe initial velocity is in\r\n'b'proportion to the quantity of powder used. In the fabrication of\r\n'b'these pieces, everything depends on employing a metal with the highest\r\n'b'possible power of resistance, and steel is incontestably that metal of\r\n'b'all others which resists the best. I have, therefore, reason to believe\r\n'b'that our guns will bear without risk the expansion of the pyroxyle gas,\r\n'b'and will give excellent results.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall be a great deal more certain of that when we have tried them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' answered Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is unnecessary to say that the four cannons were in perfect order.\r\n'b'Since they had been taken from the water, the sailor had bestowed great\r\n'b'care upon them. How many hours he had spent, in rubbing, greasing, and\r\n'b'polishing them, and in cleaning the mechanism! And now the pieces were\r\n'b'as brilliant as if they had been on board a frigate of the United States\r\n'b'Navy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this day, therefore, in presence of all the members of the colony,\r\n'b'including Master Jup and Top, the four cannon were successively tried.\r\n'b'They were charged with pyroxyle, taking into consideration its explosive\r\n'b'power, which, as has been said, is four times that of ordinary powder:\r\n'b'the projectile to be fired was cylindroconic.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, holding the end of the quick-match, stood ready to fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At Harding\xe2\x80\x99s signal, he fired. The shot, passing over the islet,\r\n'b'fell into the sea at a distance which could not be calculated with\r\n'b'exactitude.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The second gun was pointed at the rocks at the end of Flotsam Point, and\r\n'b'the shot striking a sharp rock nearly three miles from Granite House,\r\n'b'made it fly into splinters. It was Herbert who had pointed this gun and\r\n'b'fired it, and very proud he was of his first shot. Pencroft only was\r\n'b'prouder than he! Such a shot, the honor of which belonged to his dear\r\n'b'boy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The third shot, aimed this time at the downs forming the upper side\r\n'b'of Union Bay, struck the sand at a distance of four miles, then having\r\n'b'ricocheted: was lost in the sea in a cloud of spray.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For the fourth piece Cyrus Harding slightly increased the charge, so\r\n'b'as to try its extreme range. Then, all standing aside for fear of its\r\n'b'bursting, the match was lighted by means of a long cord.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A tremendous report was heard, but the piece had held good, and the\r\n'b'colonists rushing to the windows, saw the shot graze the rocks of\r\n'b'Mandible Cape, nearly five miles from Granite House, and disappear in\r\n'b'Shark Gulf.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, whose cheers might have rivaled the\r\n'b'reports themselves, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat do you say of our battery? All the pirates in\r\n'b'the Pacific have only to present themselves before Granite House! Not\r\n'b'one can land there now without our permission!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBelieve me, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cit would be better not to\r\n'b'have to make the experiment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat ought to be done with regard to those\r\n'b'six villains who are roaming about the island? Are we to leave them\r\n'b'to overrun our forests, our fields, our plantations? These pirates are\r\n'b'regular jaguars, and it seems to me we ought not to hesitate to treat\r\n'b'them as such! What do you think, Ayrton?\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft, turning to his\r\n'b'companion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton hesitated at first to reply, and Cyrus Harding regretted that\r\n'b'Pencroft had so thoughtlessly put this question. And he was much moved\r\n'b'when Ayrton replied in a humble tone,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have been one of those jaguars, Mr. Pencroft. I have no right to\r\n'b'speak.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And with a slow step he walked away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft understood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a brute I am!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor Ayrton! He has as much right to\r\n'b'speak here as any one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut his reserve does him honor, and it is\r\n'b'right to respect the feeling which he has about his sad past.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand there is no fear of\r\n'b'my doing so again. I would rather bite my tongue off than cause Ayrton\r\n'b'any pain! But to return to the question. It seems to me that these\r\n'b'ruffians have no right to any pity, and that we ought to rid the island\r\n'b'of them as soon as possible.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs that your opinion, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cQuite my opinion.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd before hunting them mercilessly, you would not wait until they had\r\n'b'committed some fresh act of hostility against us?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIsn\xe2\x80\x99t what they have done already enough?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft, who did not\r\n'b'understand these scruples.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey may adopt other sentiments!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand perhaps repent.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey repent!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft, think of Ayrton!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, taking the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cHe\r\n'b'became an honest man again!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft looked at his companions one after the other. He had never\r\n'b'thought of his proposal being met with any objection. His rough nature\r\n'b'could not allow that they ought to come to terms with the rascals who\r\n'b'had landed on the island with Bob Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s accomplices, the murderers of\r\n'b'the crew of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy,\xe2\x80\x9d and he looked upon them as wild beasts which\r\n'b'ought to be destroyed without delay and without remorse.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome!\xe2\x80\x9d said be. \xe2\x80\x9cEverybody is against me! You wish to be generous to\r\n'b'those villains! Very well; I hope we mayn\xe2\x80\x99t repent it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat danger shall we run,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cif we take care to be always\r\n'b'on our guard?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHum!\xe2\x80\x9d observed the reporter, who had not given any decided opinion.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey are six and well armed. If they each lay hid in a corner, and each\r\n'b'fired at one of us, they would soon be masters of the colony!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy have they not done so?\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cNo doubt because it was not\r\n'b'their interest to do it. Besides, we are six also.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, well!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, whom no reasoning could have convinced.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us leave these good people to do what they like, and don\xe2\x80\x99t think\r\n'b'anything more about them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t make yourself out so bad as all that!\r\n'b'Suppose one of these unfortunate men were here before you, within good\r\n'b'range of your guns, you would not fire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI would fire on him as I would on a mad dog, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft\r\n'b'coldly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cyou have always shown much deference to\r\n'b'my advice; will you, in this matter, yield to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will do as you please, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor, who was\r\n'b'not at all convinced.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well, wait, and we will not attack them unless we are attacked\r\n'b'first.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus their behavior towards the pirates was agreed upon, although\r\n'b'Pencroft augured nothing good from it. They were not to attack them, but\r\n'b'were to be on their guard. After all, the island was large and fertile.\r\n'b'If any sentiment of honesty yet remained in the bottom of their hearts,\r\n'b'these wretches might perhaps be reclaimed. Was it not their interest in\r\n'b'the situation in which they found themselves to begin a new life? At\r\n'b'any rate, for humanity\xe2\x80\x99s sake alone, it would be right to wait. The\r\n'b'colonists would no longer as before, be able to go and come without\r\n'b'fear. Hitherto they had only wild beasts to guard against, and now six\r\n'b'convicts of the worst description, perhaps, were roaming over their\r\n'b'island. It was serious, certainly, and to less brave men, it would have\r\n'b'been security lost! No matter! At present, the colonists had reason on\r\n'b'their side against Pencroft. Would they be right in the future? That\r\n'b'remained to be seen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 6\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the chief business of the colonists was to make that complete\r\n'b'exploration of the island which had been decided upon, and which would\r\n'b'have two objects: to discover the mysterious being whose existence was\r\n'b'now indisputable, and at the same time to find out what had become of\r\n'b'the pirates, what retreat they had chosen, what sort of life they were\r\n'b'leading, and what was to be feared from them. Cyrus Harding wished\r\n'b'to set out without delay; but as the expedition would be of some days\r\n'b'duration, it appeared best to load the cart with different materials and\r\n'b'tools in order to facilitate the organization of the encampments. One\r\n'b'of the onagers, however, having hurt its leg, could not be harnessed\r\n'b'at present, and a few days\xe2\x80\x99 rest was necessary. The departure was,\r\n'b'therefore, put off for a week, until the 20th of November. The month\r\n'b'of November in this latitude corresponds to the month of May in the\r\n'b'northern zones. It was, therefore, the fine season. The sun was entering\r\n'b'the tropic of Capricorn, and gave the longest days in the year. The time\r\n'b'was, therefore, very favorable for the projected expedition, which,\r\n'b'if it did not accomplish its principal object, would at any rate be\r\n'b'fruitful in discoveries, especially of natural productions, since\r\n'b'Harding proposed to explore those dense forests of the Far West, which\r\n'b'stretched to the extremity of the Serpentine Peninsula.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the nine days which preceded their departure, it was agreed that\r\n'b'the work on Prospect Heights should be finished off.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Moreover, it was necessary for Ayrton to return to the corral, where the\r\n'b'domesticated animals required his care. It was decided that he should\r\n'b'spend two days there, and return to Granite House after having liberally\r\n'b'supplied the stables.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As he was about to start, Harding asked him if he would not like one\r\n'b'of them to accompany him, observing that the island was less safe than\r\n'b'formerly. Ayrton replied that this was unnecessary, as he was enough\r\n'b'for the work, and that besides he apprehended no danger. If anything\r\n'b'occurred at the corral, or in the neighborhood, he could instantly warn\r\n'b'the colonists by sending a telegram to Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton departed at dawn on the 9th, taking the cart drawn by one onager,\r\n'b'and two hours after, the electric wire announced that he had found all\r\n'b'in order at the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During these two days Harding busied himself in executing a project\r\n'b'which would completely guard Granite House against any surprise. It was\r\n'b'necessary to completely conceal the opening of the old outlet, which\r\n'b'was already walled up and partly hidden under grass and plants, at the\r\n'b'southern angle of Lake Grant. Nothing was easier, since if the level\r\n'b'of the lake was raised two or three feet, the opening would be quite\r\n'b'beneath it. Now, to raise this level they had only to establish a dam at\r\n'b'the two openings made by the lake, and by which were fed Creek Glycerine\r\n'b'and Falls River.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists worked with a will, and the two dams which besides did not\r\n'b'exceed eight feet in width by three in height, were rapidly erected by\r\n'b'means of well-cemented blocks of stone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This work finished, it would have been impossible to guess that at that\r\n'b'part of the lake, there existed a subterranean passage through which the\r\n'b'overflow of the lake formerly escaped.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Of course the little stream which fed the reservoir of Granite House and\r\n'b'worked the lift, had been carefully preserved, and the water could not\r\n'b'fail. The lift once raised, this sure and comfortable retreat would be\r\n'b'safe from any surprise.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This work had been so quickly done, that Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and\r\n'b'Herbert found time to make an expedition to Port Balloon, The sailor was\r\n'b'very anxious to know if the little creek in which the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was\r\n'b'moored, had been visited by the convicts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThese gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d he observed, \xe2\x80\x9clanded on the south coast, and if they\r\n'b'followed the shore, it is to be feared that they may have discovered the\r\n'b'little harbor, and in that case, I wouldn\xe2\x80\x99t give half-a-dollar for our\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s apprehensions were not without foundation, and a visit\r\n'b'to Port Balloon appeared to be very desirable. The sailor and his\r\n'b'companions set off on the 10th of November, after dinner, well armed.\r\n'b'Pencroft, ostentatiously slipping two bullets into each barrel of his\r\n'b'rifle, shook his head in a way which betokened nothing good to any one\r\n'b'who approached too near him, whether \xe2\x80\x9cman or beast,\xe2\x80\x9d as he said. Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett and Herbert also took their guns, and about three o\xe2\x80\x99clock all\r\n'b'three left Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb accompanied them to the turn of the Mercy, and after they had\r\n'b'crossed, he raised the bridge. It was agreed that a gunshot should\r\n'b'announce the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 return, and that at the signal Neb should return\r\n'b'and reestablish the communication between the two banks of the river.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The little band advanced directly along the road which led to the\r\n'b'southern coast of the island. This was only a distance of three miles\r\n'b'and a half, but Gideon Spilett and his companions took two hours to\r\n'b'traverse it. They examined all the border of the road, the thick forest,\r\n'b'as well as Tabor Marsh. They found no trace of the fugitives who, no\r\n'b'doubt, not having yet discovered the number of the colonists, or the\r\n'b'means of defense which they had at their disposal, had gained the less\r\n'b'accessible parts of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Arrived at Port Balloon, Pencroft saw with extreme satisfaction that\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was tranquilly floating in the narrow creek. However,\r\n'b'Port Balloon was so well hidden among high rocks, that it could scarcely\r\n'b'be discovered either from the land or the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthe blackguards have not been there yet. Long\r\n'b'grass suits reptiles best, and evidently we shall find them in the Far\r\n'b'West.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd it\xe2\x80\x99s very lucky, for if they had found the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\n'b'Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cthey would have gone off in her, and we should have been\r\n'b'prevented from returning to Tabor Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIndeed,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cit will be important to take a\r\n'b'document there which will make known the situation of Lincoln Island,\r\n'b'and Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s new residence, in case the Scotch yacht returns to fetch\r\n'b'him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 is always there, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the\r\n'b'sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cShe and her crew are ready to start at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think, Pencroft, that that is a thing to be done after our\r\n'b'exploration of the island is finished. It is possible after all that the\r\n'b'stranger, if we manage to find him, may know as much about Tabor Island\r\n'b'as about Lincoln Island. Do not forget that he is certainly the author\r\n'b'of the document, and he may, perhaps, know how far we may count on the\r\n'b'return of the yacht!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwho in the world can he be? The fellow knows\r\n'b'us and we know nothing about him! If he is a simple castaway, why should\r\n'b'he conceal himself! We are honest men, I suppose, and the society of\r\n'b'honest men isn\xe2\x80\x99t unpleasant to any one. Did he come here voluntarily?\r\n'b'Can he leave the island if he likes? Is he here still? Will he remain\r\n'b'any longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chatting thus, Pencroft, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert got on board and\r\n'b'looked about the deck of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure.\xe2\x80\x9d All at once, the sailor\r\n'b'having examined the bitts to which the cable of the anchor was\r\n'b'secured,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHallo,\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cthis is queer!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is the matter, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe matter is, that it was not I who made this knot!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And Pencroft showed a rope which fastened the cable to the bitt itself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat, it was not you?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo! I can swear to it. This is a reef knot, and I always make a running\r\n'b'bowline.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou must be mistaken, Pencroft.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not mistaken!\xe2\x80\x9d declared the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cMy hand does it so naturally,\r\n'b'and one\xe2\x80\x99s hand is never mistaken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen can the convicts have been on board?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI know nothing about that,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cbut what is certain,\r\n'b'is that some one has weighed the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x99 anchor and dropped it\r\n'b'again! And look here, here is another proof! The cable of the anchor has\r\n'b'been run out, and its service is no longer at the hawse-hole. I repeat\r\n'b'that some one has been using our vessel!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut if the convicts had used her, they would have pillaged her, or\r\n'b'rather gone off with her.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGone off! where to--to Tabor Island?\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cDo you think,\r\n'b'they would risk themselves in a boat of such small tonnage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must, besides, be sure that they know of the islet,\xe2\x80\x9d rejoined the\r\n'b'reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHowever that may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cas sure as my name is\r\n'b'Bonadventure Pencroft, of the Vineyard, our \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 has sailed\r\n'b'without us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor was positive that neither Gideon Spilett nor Herbert could\r\n'b'dispute his statement. It was evident that the vessel had been moved,\r\n'b'more or less, since Pencroft had brought her to Port Balloon. As to the\r\n'b'sailor, he had not the slightest doubt that the anchor had been raised\r\n'b'and then dropped again. Now, what was the use of these two maneuvers,\r\n'b'unless the vessel had been employed in some expedition?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut how was it we did not see the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 pass in the sight of\r\n'b'the island?\xe2\x80\x9d observed the reporter, who was anxious to bring forward\r\n'b'every possible objection.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthey would only have to start\r\n'b'in the night with a good breeze, and they would be out of sight of the\r\n'b'island in two hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cI ask again, what object could the\r\n'b'convicts have had in using the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure,\xe2\x80\x99 and why, after they had\r\n'b'made use of her, should they have brought her back to port?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhy, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must put that among the\r\n'b'unaccountable things, and not think anything more about it. The chief\r\n'b'thing is that the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 was there, and she is there now. Only,\r\n'b'unfortunately, if the convicts take her a second time, we shall very\r\n'b'likely not find her again in her place!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwould it not be wisest to bring the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 off to Granite House?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes and no,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cor rather no. The mouth of the Mercy\r\n'b'is a bad place for a vessel, and the sea is heavy there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut by hauling her up on the sand, to the foot of the Chimneys?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps yes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate, since we must leave\r\n'b'Granite House for a long expedition, I think the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 will be\r\n'b'safer here during our absence, and we shall do best to leave her here\r\n'b'until the island is rid of these blackguards.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is exactly my opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate in the\r\n'b'event of bad weather, she will not be exposed here as she would be at\r\n'b'the mouth of the Mercy.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut suppose the convicts pay her another visit,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cnot finding her here, they would not\r\n'b'be long in finding her on the sands of Granite House, and, during our\r\n'b'absence, nothing could hinder them from seizing her! I agree, therefore,\r\n'b'with Mr. Spilett, that she must be left in Port Balloon. But, if on our\r\n'b'return we have not rid the island of those rascals, it will be prudent\r\n'b'to bring our boat to Granite House, until the time when we need not fear\r\n'b'any unpleasant visits.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s settled. Let us be off,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, Herbert, and Gideon Spilett, on their return to Granite House,\r\n'b'told the engineer all that had passed, and the latter approved of their\r\n'b'arrangements both for the present and the future. He also promised the\r\n'b'sailor that he would study that part of the channel situated between the\r\n'b'islet and the coast, so as to ascertain if it would not be possible\r\n'b'to make an artificial harbor there by means of dams. In this way, the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d would be always within reach, under the eyes of the\r\n'b'colonists, and if necessary, under lock and key.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That evening a telegram was sent to Ayrton, requesting him to bring from\r\n'b'the corral a couple of goats, which Neb wished to acclimatize to the\r\n'b'plateau. Singularly enough, Ayrton did not acknowledge the receipt of\r\n'b'the despatch, as he was accustomed to do. This could not but astonish\r\n'b'the engineer. But it might be that Ayrton was not at that moment in the\r\n'b'corral, or even that he was on his way back to Granite House. In fact,\r\n'b'two days had already passed since his departure, and it had been decided\r\n'b'that on the evening of the 10th or at the latest the morning of the\r\n'b'11th, he should return. The colonists waited, therefore, for Ayrton to\r\n'b'appear on Prospect Heights. Neb and Herbert even watched at the bridge\r\n'b'so as to be ready to lower it the moment their companion presented\r\n'b'himself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But up to ten in the evening, there were no signs of Ayrton. It was,\r\n'b'therefore, judged best to send a fresh despatch, requiring an immediate\r\n'b'reply.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The bell of the telegraph at Granite House remained mute.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists\xe2\x80\x99 uneasiness was great. What had happened? Was Ayrton no\r\n'b'longer at the corral, or if he was still there, had he no longer control\r\n'b'over his movements? Could they go to the corral in this dark night?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They consulted. Some wished to go, the others to remain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cperhaps some accident has happened to the\r\n'b'telegraphic apparatus, so that it works no longer?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWait till to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible, indeed,\r\n'b'that Ayrton has not received our despatch, or even that we have not\r\n'b'received his.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They waited, of course not without some anxiety.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At dawn of day, the 11th of November, Harding again sent the electric\r\n'b'current along the wire and received no reply.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He tried again: the same result.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOff to the corral,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd well armed!\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was immediately decided that Granite House should not be left alone\r\n'b'and that Neb should remain there. After having accompanied his friends\r\n'b'to Creek Glycerine, he raised the bridge; and waiting behind a tree he\r\n'b'watched for the return of either his companions or Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the event of the pirates presenting themselves and attempting to\r\n'b'force the passage, he was to endeavor to stop them by firing on them,\r\n'b'and as a last resource he was to take refuge in Granite House, where,\r\n'b'the lift once raised, he would be in safety.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, and Pencroft were to repair\r\n'b'to the corral, and if they did not find Ayrton, search the neighboring\r\n'b'woods.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning, the engineer and his three companions\r\n'b'had passed Creek Glycerine, and Neb posted himself behind a small mound\r\n'b'crowned by several dragon trees, on the left bank of the stream.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists, after leaving the plateau of Prospect Heights,\r\n'b'immediately took the road to the corral. They shouldered their guns,\r\n'b'ready to fire on the slightest hostile demonstration. The two rifles and\r\n'b'the two guns had been loaded with ball.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The wood was thick on each side of the road and might easily have\r\n'b'concealed the convicts, who owing to their weapons would have been\r\n'b'really formidable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists walked rapidly and in silence. Top preceded them,\r\n'b'sometimes running on the road, sometimes taking a ramble into the wood,\r\n'b'but always quiet and not appearing to fear anything unusual. And\r\n'b'they could be sure that the faithful dog would not allow them to be\r\n'b'surprised, but would bark at the least appearance of danger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions followed beside the road the wire which\r\n'b'connected the corral with Granite House. After walking for nearly two\r\n'b'miles, they had not as yet discovered any explanation of the difficulty.\r\n'b'The posts were in good order, the wire regularly extended. However, at\r\n'b'that moment the engineer observed that the wire appeared to be slack,\r\n'b'and on arriving at post No. 74, Herbert, who was in advance stopped,\r\n'b'exclaiming,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe wire is broken!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His companions hurried forward and arrived at the spot where the lad\r\n'b'was standing. The post was rooted up and lying across the path. The\r\n'b'unexpected explanation of the difficulty was here, and it was evident\r\n'b'that the despatches from Granite House had not been received at the\r\n'b'corral, nor those from the corral at Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt wasn\xe2\x80\x99t the wind that blew down this post,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cThe earth has been dug up round its foot,\r\n'b'and it has been torn up by the hand of man.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBesides, the wire is broken,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert, showing that the wire had\r\n'b'been snapped.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs the fracture recent?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cit has certainly been done quite lately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo the corral! to the corral!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists were now half way between Granite House and the corral,\r\n'b'having still two miles and a half to go. They pressed forward with\r\n'b'redoubled speed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Indeed, it was to be feared that some serious accident had occurred in\r\n'b'the corral. No doubt, Ayrton might have sent a telegram which had not\r\n'b'arrived, but this was not the reason why his companions were so uneasy,\r\n'b'for, a more unaccountable circumstance, Ayrton, who had promised to\r\n'b'return the evening before, had not reappeared. In short, it was not\r\n'b'without a motive that all communication had been stopped between the\r\n'b'corral and Granite House, and who but the convicts could have any\r\n'b'interest in interrupting this communication?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers hastened on, their hearts oppressed with anxiety. They were\r\n'b'sincerely attached to their new companion. Were they to find him struck\r\n'b'down by the hands of those of whom he was formerly the leader?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Soon they arrived at the place where the road led along the side of the\r\n'b'little stream which flowed from the Red Creek and watered the meadows\r\n'b'of the corral. They then moderated their pace so that they should not\r\n'b'be out of breath at the moment when a struggle might be necessary. Their\r\n'b'guns were in their hands ready cocked. The forest was watched on every\r\n'b'side. Top uttered sullen groans which were rather ominous.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last the palisade appeared through the trees. No trace of any damage\r\n'b'could be seen. The gate was shut as usual. Deep silence reigned in the\r\n'b'corral. Neither the accustomed bleating of the sheep nor Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s voice\r\n'b'could be heard.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us enter,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the engineer advanced, while his companions, keeping watch about\r\n'b'twenty paces behind him, were ready to fire at a moment\xe2\x80\x99s notice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding raised the inner latch of the gate and was about to push it\r\n'b'back, when Top barked loudly. A report sounded and was responded to by a\r\n'b'cry of pain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert, struck by a bullet, lay stretched on the ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 7\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s cry, Pencroft, letting his gun fall, rushed towards him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey have killed him!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried. \xe2\x80\x9cMy boy! They have killed him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ran to Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter listened to ascertain if the poor lad\xe2\x80\x99s heart was still\r\n'b'beating.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe lives,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he must be carried--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo Granite House? that is impossible!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cInto the corral, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And he ran round the left corner of the palisade. There he found a\r\n'b'convict, who aiming at him, sent a ball through his hat. In a few\r\n'b'seconds, before he had even time to fire his second barrel, he fell,\r\n'b'struck to the heart by Harding\xe2\x80\x99s dagger, more sure even than his gun.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During this time, Gideon Spilett and the sailor hoisted themselves over\r\n'b'the palisade, leaped into the enclosure, threw down the props which\r\n'b'supported the inner door, ran into the empty house, and soon, poor\r\n'b'Herbert was lying on Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s bed. In a few moments, Harding was by his\r\n'b'side.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On seeing Herbert senseless, the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s grief was terrible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He sobbed, he cried, he tried to beat his head against the wall.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neither the engineer nor the reporter could calm him. They themselves\r\n'b'were choked with emotion. They could not speak.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, they knew that it depended on them to rescue from death the\r\n'b'poor boy who was suffering beneath their eyes. Gideon Spilett had not\r\n'b'passed through the many incidents by which his life had been checkered\r\n'b'without acquiring some slight knowledge of medicine. He knew a little\r\n'b'of everything, and several times he had been obliged to attend to wounds\r\n'b'produced either by a sword-bayonet or shot. Assisted by Cyrus Harding,\r\n'b'he proceeded to render the aid Herbert required.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter was immediately struck by the complete stupor in which\r\n'b'Herbert lay, a stupor owing either to the hemorrhage, or to the shock,\r\n'b'the ball having struck a bone with sufficient force to produce a violent\r\n'b'concussion.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert was deadly pale, and his pulse so feeble that Spilett only felt\r\n'b'it beat at long intervals, as if it was on the point of stopping.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These symptoms were very serious.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s chest was laid bare, and the blood having been stanched with\r\n'b'handkerchiefs, it was bathed with cold water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The contusion, or rather the contused wound appeared,--an oval below the\r\n'b'chest between the third and fourth ribs. It was there that Herbert had\r\n'b'been hit by the bullet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett then turned the poor boy over; as they\r\n'b'did so, he uttered a moan so feeble that they almost thought it was his\r\n'b'last sigh.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herberts back was covered with blood from another contused wound, by\r\n'b'which the ball had immediately escaped.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGod be praised!\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cthe ball is not in the body, and\r\n'b'we shall not have to extract it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut the heart?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe heart has not been touched; if it had been, Herbert would be dead!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDead!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, with a groan.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor had only heard the last words uttered by the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cno! He is not dead. His pulse\r\n'b'still beats. He has even uttered a moan. But for your boy\xe2\x80\x99s sake, calm\r\n'b'yourself. We have need of all our self-possession.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo not make us lose it, my friend.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft was silent, but a reaction set in, and great tears rolled down\r\n'b'his cheeks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile, Gideon Spilett endeavored to collect his ideas, and\r\n'b'proceed methodically. After his examination he had no doubt that the\r\n'b'ball, entering in front, between the seventh and eighth ribs, had issued\r\n'b'behind between the third and fourth. But what mischief had the ball\r\n'b'committed in its passage? What important organs had been reached? A\r\n'b'professional surgeon would have had difficulty in determining this at\r\n'b'once, and still more so the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, he knew one thing, this was that he would have to prevent the\r\n'b'inflammatory strangulation of the injured parts, then to contend with\r\n'b'the local inflammation and fever which would result from the wound,\r\n'b'perhaps mortal! Now, what styptics, what antiphlogistics ought to be\r\n'b'employed? By what means could inflammation be prevented?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At any rate, the most important thing was that the two wounds should\r\n'b'be dressed without delay. It did not appear necessary to Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'that a fresh flow of blood should be caused by bathing them in tepid\r\n'b'water, and compressing their lips. The hemorrhage had been very\r\n'b'abundant, and Herbert was already too much enfeebled by the loss of\r\n'b'blood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter, therefore, thought it best to simply bathe the two wounds\r\n'b'with cold water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert was placed on his left side, and was maintained in that\r\n'b'position.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe must not be moved.\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cHe is in the most\r\n'b'favorable position for the wounds in his back and chest to suppurate\r\n'b'easily, and absolute rest is necessary.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! can\xe2\x80\x99t we carry him to Granite House?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI\xe2\x80\x99ll pay the villains off!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the sailor, shaking his fist in a\r\n'b'menacing manner.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett had resumed his examination of the wounded boy. Herbert\r\n'b'was still so frightfully pale, that the reporter felt anxious.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI am not a surgeon. I am in terrible perplexity. You\r\n'b'must aid me with your advice, your experience!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTake courage, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, pressing the\r\n'b'reporter\xe2\x80\x99s hand. \xe2\x80\x9cJudge coolly. Think only of this: Herbert must be\r\n'b'saved!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These words restored to Gideon Spilett that self-possession which he had\r\n'b'lost in a moment of discouragement on feeling his great responsibility.\r\n'b'He seated himself close to the bed. Cyrus Harding stood near. Pencroft\r\n'b'had torn up his shirt, and was mechanically making lint.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Spilett then explained to Cyrus Harding that he thought he ought first\r\n'b'of all to stop the hemorrhage, but not close the two wounds, or cause\r\n'b'their immediate cicatrization, for there had been internal perforation,\r\n'b'and the suppuration must not be allowed to accumulate in the chest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding approved entirely, and it was decided that the two wounds should\r\n'b'be dressed without attempting to close them by immediate coaptation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And now did the colonists possess an efficacious agent to act against\r\n'b'the inflammation which might occur?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Yes. They had one, for nature had generously lavished it. They had cold\r\n'b'water, that is to say, the most powerful sedative that can be employed\r\n'b'against inflammation of wounds, the most efficacious therapeutic agent\r\n'b'in grave cases, and the one which is now adopted by all physicians.\r\n'b'Cold water has, moreover, the advantage of leaving the wound in absolute\r\n'b'rest, and preserving it from all premature dressing, a considerable\r\n'b'advantage, since it has been found by experience that contact with the\r\n'b'air is dangerous during the first days.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett and Cyrus Harding reasoned thus with their simple good\r\n'b'sense, and they acted as the best surgeon would have done. Compresses\r\n'b'of linen were applied to poor Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s two wounds, and were kept\r\n'b'constantly wet with cold water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor had at first lighted a fire in the hut, which was not wanting\r\n'b'in things necessary for life. Maple sugar, medicinal plants, the same\r\n'b'which the lad had gathered on the banks of Lake Grant, enabled them to\r\n'b'make some refreshing drinks, which they gave him without his taking any\r\n'b'notice of it. His fever was extremely high, and all that day and night\r\n'b'passed without his becoming conscious.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s life hung on a thread, and this thread might break at any\r\n'b'moment. The next day, the 12th of November, the hopes of Harding and his\r\n'b'companions slightly revived. Herbert had come out of his long stupor.\r\n'b'He opened his eyes, he recognized Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and\r\n'b'Pencroft. He uttered two or three words. He did not know what had\r\n'b'happened. They told him, and Spilett begged him to remain perfectly\r\n'b'still, telling him that his life was not in danger, and that his wounds\r\n'b'would heal in a few days. However, Herbert scarcely suffered at all,\r\n'b'and the cold water with which they were constantly bathed, prevented any\r\n'b'inflammation of the wounds. The suppuration was established in a regular\r\n'b'way, the fever did not increase, and it might now be hoped that this\r\n'b'terrible wound would not involve any catastrophe. Pencroft felt the\r\n'b'swelling of his heart gradually subside. He was like a sister of mercy,\r\n'b'like a mother by the bed of her child.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert dozed again, but his sleep appeared more natural.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTell me again that you hope, Mr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cTell me\r\n'b'again that you will save Herbert!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we will save him!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe wound is serious,\r\n'b'and, perhaps, even the ball has traversed the lungs, but the perforation\r\n'b'of this organ is not fatal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGod bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As may be believed, during the four-and-twenty hours they had been in\r\n'b'the corral, the colonists had no other thought than that of nursing\r\n'b'Herbert. They did not think either of the danger which threatened them\r\n'b'should the convicts return, or of the precautions to be taken for the\r\n'b'future.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But on this day, while Pencroft watched by the sick-bed, Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'and the reporter consulted as to what it would be best to do.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'First of all they examined the corral. There was not a trace of Ayrton.\r\n'b'Had the unhappy man been dragged away by his former accomplices? Had he\r\n'b'resisted, and been overcome in the struggle? This last supposition was\r\n'b'only too probable. Gideon Spilett, at the moment he scaled the palisade,\r\n'b'had clearly seen some one of the convicts running along the southern\r\n'b'spur of Mount Franklin, towards whom Top had sprung. It was one of those\r\n'b'whose object had been so completely defeated by the rocks at the mouth\r\n'b'of the Mercy. Besides, the one killed by Harding, and whose body was\r\n'b'found outside the enclosure, of course belonged to Bob Harvey\xe2\x80\x99s crew.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the corral, it had not suffered any damage. The gates were closed,\r\n'b'and the animals had not been able to disperse in the forest. Nor could\r\n'b'they see traces of any struggle, any devastation, either in the hut,\r\n'b'or in the palisade. The ammunition only, with which Ayrton had been\r\n'b'supplied, had disappeared with him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe unhappy man has been surprised,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand as he was a man\r\n'b'to defend himself, he must have been overpowered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, that is to be feared!\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cThen, doubtless, the\r\n'b'convicts installed themselves in the corral where they found plenty of\r\n'b'everything, and only fled when they saw us coming. It is very evident,\r\n'b'too, that at this moment Ayrton, whether living or dead, is not here!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have to beat the forest,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cand rid the\r\n'b'island of these wretches. Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s presentiments were not mistaken,\r\n'b'when he wished to hunt them as wild beasts. That would have spared us\r\n'b'all these misfortunes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cbut now we have the right to be\r\n'b'merciless!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe are obliged to wait some time,\r\n'b'and to remain at the corral until we can carry Herbert without danger to\r\n'b'Granite House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut Neb?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNeb is in safety.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut if, uneasy at our absence, he would venture to come?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe must not come!\xe2\x80\x9d returned Cyrus Harding quickly. \xe2\x80\x9cHe would be\r\n'b'murdered on the road!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very probable, however, that he will attempt to rejoin us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh, if the telegraph still acted, he might be warned! But that is\r\n'b'impossible now! As to leaving Pencroft and Herbert here alone, we could\r\n'b'not do it! Well, I will go alone to Granite House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, no! Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cyou must not expose yourself!\r\n'b'Your courage would be of no avail. The villains are evidently watching\r\n'b'the corral, they are hidden in the thick woods which surround it, and if\r\n'b'you go we shall soon have to regret two misfortunes instead of one!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut Neb?\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is now four-and-twenty hours since\r\n'b'he has had any news of us! He will be sure to come!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd as he will be less on his guard than we should be ourselves,\xe2\x80\x9d added\r\n'b'Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9che will be killed!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIs there really no way of warning him?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While the engineer thought, his eyes fell on Top, who, going backwards\r\n'b'and forwards seemed to say,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAm not I here?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The animal sprang at his master\xe2\x80\x99s call.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Top will go,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, who had understood the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop can go where we cannot! He will carry to Granite House the news of\r\n'b'the corral, and he will bring back to us that from Granite House!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cQuick!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Spilett rapidly tore a leaf from his note-book, and wrote these words:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert wounded. We are at the corral. Be on your guard. Do not leave\r\n'b'Granite House. Have the convicts appeared in the neighborhood? Reply by\r\n'b'Top.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This laconic note contained all that Neb ought to know, and at the same\r\n'b'time asked all that the colonists wished to know. It was folded and\r\n'b'fastened to Top\xe2\x80\x99s collar in a conspicuous position.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop, my dog,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, caressing the animal, \xe2\x80\x9cNeb, Top! Neb!\r\n'b'Go, go!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top bounded at these words. He understood, he knew what was expected of\r\n'b'him. The road to the corral was familiar to him. In less than an hour he\r\n'b'could clear it, and it might be hoped that where neither Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'nor the reporter could have ventured without danger, Top, running among\r\n'b'the grass or in the wood, would pass unperceived.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer went to the gate of the corral and opened it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNeb, Top! Neb!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the engineer, again pointing in the direction\r\n'b'of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top sprang forwards, then almost immediately disappeared.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe will get there!\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and he will come back, the faithful animal!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat o\xe2\x80\x99clock is it?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTen.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn an hour he may be here. We will watch for his return.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The gate of the corral was closed. The engineer and the reporter\r\n'b're-entered the house. Herbert was still in a sleep. Pencroft kept the\r\n'b'compresses always wet. Spilett, seeing there was nothing he could do\r\n'b'at that moment, busied himself in preparing some nourishment, while\r\n'b'attentively watching that part of the enclosure against the hill, at\r\n'b'which an attack might be expected.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The settlers awaited Top\xe2\x80\x99s return with much anxiety. A little before\r\n'b'eleven o\xe2\x80\x99clock, Cyrus Harding and the reporter, rifle in hand, were\r\n'b'behind the gate, ready to open it at the first bark of their dog.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They did not doubt that if Top had arrived safely at Granite House, Neb\r\n'b'would have sent him back immediately.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had both been there for about ten minutes, when a report was heard,\r\n'b'followed by repeated barks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer opened the gate, and seeing smoke a hundred feet off in the\r\n'b'wood, he fired in that direction.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Almost immediately Top bounded into the corral, and the gate was quickly\r\n'b'shut.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTop, Top!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the engineer, taking the dog\xe2\x80\x99s great honest head\r\n'b'between his hands.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A note was fastened to his neck, and Cyrus Harding read these words,\r\n'b'traced in Neb\xe2\x80\x99s large writing:--\xe2\x80\x9cNo pirates in the neighborhood of\r\n'b'Granite House. I will not stir. Poor Mr. Herbert!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 8\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So the convicts were still there, watching the corral, and determined to\r\n'b'kill the settlers one after the other. There was nothing to be done but\r\n'b'to treat them as wild beasts. But great precautions must be taken, for\r\n'b'just now the wretches had the advantage on their side, seeing, and not\r\n'b'being seen, being able to surprise by the suddenness of their attack,\r\n'b'yet not to be surprised themselves. Harding made arrangements,\r\n'b'therefore, for living in the corral, of which the provisions would last\r\n'b'for a tolerable length of time. Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s house had been provided with\r\n'b'all that was necessary for existence, and the convicts, scared by\r\n'b'the arrival of the settlers, had not had time to pillage it. It was\r\n'b'probable, as Gideon Spilett observed, that things had occurred as\r\n'b'follows:\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The six convicts, disembarking on the island, had followed the southern\r\n'b'shore, and after having traversed the double shore of the Serpentine\r\n'b'Peninsula, not being inclined to venture into the Far West woods, they\r\n'b'had reached the mouth of Falls River. From this point, by following the\r\n'b'right bank of the watercourse, they would arrive at the spurs of Mount\r\n'b'Franklin, among which they would naturally seek a retreat, and they\r\n'b'could not have been long in discovering the corral, then uninhabited.\r\n'b'There they had regularly installed themselves, awaiting the moment\r\n'b'to put their abominable schemes into execution. Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s arrival had\r\n'b'surprised them, but they had managed to overpower the unfortunate man,\r\n'b'and--the rest may be easily imagined!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now, the convicts,--reduced to five, it is true, but well armed,--were\r\n'b'roaming the woods, and to venture there was to expose themselves to\r\n'b'their attacks, which could be neither guarded against nor prevented.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWait! There is nothing else to be done!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cWhen\r\n'b'Herbert is cured, we can organize a general battle of the island, and\r\n'b'have satisfaction of these convicts. That will be the object of our\r\n'b'grand expedition at the same time--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs the search for our mysterious protector,\xe2\x80\x9d added Gideon Spilett,\r\n'b'finishing the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s sentence. \xe2\x80\x9cAnd it must be acknowledged, my dear\r\n'b'Cyrus, that this time his protection was wanting at the very moment when\r\n'b'it was most necessary to us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you mean?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat we are not at the end of our trouble yet, my dear Spilett,\r\n'b'and that his powerful intervention may have another opportunity of\r\n'b'exercising itself. But that is not the question now. Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s life\r\n'b'before everything.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 saddest thought. Several days passed, and the\r\n'b'poor boy\xe2\x80\x99s state was happily no worse. Cold water, always kept at a\r\n'b'suitable temperature, had completely prevented the inflammation of the\r\n'b'wounds. It even seemed to the reporter that this water, being slightly\r\n'b'sulphurous,--which was explained by the neighborhood of the volcano,\r\n'b'had a more direct action on the healing. The suppuration was much\r\n'b'less abundant, and thanks to the incessant care by which he was\r\n'b'surrounded!--Herbert returned to life, and his fever abated. He was\r\n'b'besides subjected to a severe diet, and consequently his weakness was\r\n'b'and would be extreme; but there was no want of refreshing drinks, and\r\n'b'absolute rest was of the greatest benefit to him. Cyrus Harding, Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, and Pencroft had become very skilful in dressing the lad\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'wounds. All the linen in the house had been sacrificed. Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'wounds, covered with compresses and lint, were pressed neither too much\r\n'b'nor too little, so as to cause their cicatrization without effecting any\r\n'b'inflammatory reaction. The reporter used extreme care in the dressing,\r\n'b'knowing well the importance of it, and repeating to his companions that\r\n'b'which most surgeons willingly admit, that it is perhaps rarer to see a\r\n'b'dressing well done than an operation well performed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In ten days, on the 22nd of November, Herbert was considerably better.\r\n'b'He had begun to take some nourishment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The color was returning to his cheeks, and his bright eyes smiled at\r\n'b'his nurses. He talked a little, notwithstanding Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s efforts, who\r\n'b'talked incessantly to prevent him from beginning to speak, and told him\r\n'b'the most improbable stories. Herbert had questioned him on the subject\r\n'b'of Ayrton, whom he was astonished not to see near him, thinking that\r\n'b'he was at the corral. But the sailor, not wishing to distress Herbert,\r\n'b'contented himself by replying that Ayrton had rejoined Neb, so as to\r\n'b'defend Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHumph!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthese pirates! they are gentlemen who have\r\n'b'no right to any consideration! And the captain wanted to win them by\r\n'b'kindness! I\xe2\x80\x99ll send them some kindness, but in the shape of a good\r\n'b'bullet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd have they not been seen again?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we shall find them, and when\r\n'b'you are cured we shall see if the cowards who strike us from behind will\r\n'b'dare to meet us face to face!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am still very weak, my poor Pencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell! your strength will return gradually! What\xe2\x80\x99s a ball through the\r\n'b'chest? Nothing but a joke! I\xe2\x80\x99ve seen many, and I don\xe2\x80\x99t think much of\r\n'b'them!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last things appeared to be going on well, and if no complication\r\n'b'occurred, Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s recovery might be regarded as certain. But what\r\n'b'would have been the condition of the colonists if his state had been\r\n'b'aggravated,--if, for example, the ball had remained in his body, if his\r\n'b'arm or his leg had had to be amputated?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett more than once, \xe2\x80\x9cI have never thought of such a\r\n'b'contingency without shuddering!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, if it had been necessary to operate,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding one day to\r\n'b'him, \xe2\x80\x9cyou would not have hesitated?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Cyrus!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut thank God that we have been\r\n'b'spared this complication!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As in so many other conjectures, the colonists had appealed to the logic\r\n'b'of that simple good sense of which they had made use so often, and once\r\n'b'more, thanks to their general knowledge, it had succeeded! But might not\r\n'b'a time come when all their science would be at fault? They were alone\r\n'b'on the island. Now, men in all states of society are necessary to each\r\n'b'other. Cyrus Harding knew this well, and sometimes he asked if some\r\n'b'circumstance might not occur which they would be powerless to surmount.\r\n'b'It appeared to him besides, that he and his companions, till then so\r\n'b'fortunate, had entered into an unlucky period. During the two years and\r\n'b'a half which had elapsed since their escape from Richmond, it might\r\n'b'be said that they had had everything their own way. The island had\r\n'b'abundantly supplied them with minerals, vegetables, animals, and as\r\n'b'Nature had constantly loaded them, their science had known how to take\r\n'b'advantage of what she offered them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The wellbeing of the colony was therefore complete. Moreover, in certain\r\n'b'occurrences an inexplicable influence had come to their aid!... But all\r\n'b'that could only be for a time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In short, Cyrus Harding believed that fortune had turned against them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, the convicts\xe2\x80\x99 ship had appeared in the waters of the island,\r\n'b'and if the pirates had been, so to speak, miraculously destroyed, six of\r\n'b'them, at least, had escaped the catastrophe. They had disembarked on the\r\n'b'island, and it was almost impossible to get at the five who survived.\r\n'b'Ayrton had no doubt been murdered by these wretches, who possessed\r\n'b'firearms, and at the first use that they had made of them, Herbert had\r\n'b'fallen, wounded almost mortally. Were these the first blows aimed by\r\n'b'adverse fortune at the colonists? This was often asked by Harding. This\r\n'b'was often repeated by the reporter; and it appeared to him also that the\r\n'b'intervention, so strange, yet so efficacious, which till then had served\r\n'b'them so well, had now failed them. Had this mysterious being, whatever\r\n'b'he was, whose existence could not be denied, abandoned the island? Had\r\n'b'he in his turn succumbed?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No reply was possible to these questions. But it must not be imagined\r\n'b'that because Harding and his companions spoke of these things, they were\r\n'b'men to despair. Far from that. They looked their situation in the face,\r\n'b'they analyzed the chances, they prepared themselves for any event, they\r\n'b'stood firm and straight before the future, and if adversity was at last\r\n'b'to strike them, it would find in them men prepared to struggle against\r\n'b'it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 9\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The convalescence of the young invalid was regularly progressing. One\r\n'b'thing only was now to be desired, that his state would allow him to be\r\n'b'brought to Granite House. However well built and supplied the corral\r\n'b'house was, it could not be so comfortable as the healthy granite\r\n'b'dwelling. Besides, it did not offer the same security, and its tenants,\r\n'b'notwithstanding their watchfulness, were here always in fear of some\r\n'b'shot from the convicts. There, on the contrary, in the middle of that\r\n'b'impregnable and inaccessible cliff, they would have nothing to fear, and\r\n'b'any attack on their persons would certainly fail. They therefore waited\r\n'b'impatiently for the moment when Herbert might be moved without danger\r\n'b'from his wound, and they were determined to make this move, although the\r\n'b'communication through Jacamar Wood was very difficult.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had no news from Neb, but were not uneasy on that account. The\r\n'b'courageous Negro, well entrenched in the depths of Granite House, would\r\n'b'not allow himself to be surprised. Top had not been sent again to him,\r\n'b'as it appeared useless to expose the faithful dog to some shot which\r\n'b'might deprive the settlers of their most useful auxiliary.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They waited, therefore, although they were anxious to be reunited at\r\n'b'Granite House. It pained the engineer to see his forces divided, for it\r\n'b'gave great advantage to the pirates. Since Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s disappearance they\r\n'b'were only four against five, for Herbert could not yet be counted, and\r\n'b'this was not the least care of the brave boy, who well understood the\r\n'b'trouble of which he was the cause.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The question of knowing how, in their condition, they were to act\r\n'b'against the pirates, was thoroughly discussed on the 29th of November\r\n'b'by Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Pencroft, at a moment when Herbert\r\n'b'was asleep and could not hear them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, after they had talked of Neb and of the\r\n'b'impossibility of communicating with him, \xe2\x80\x9cI think,--like you, that to\r\n'b'venture on the road to the corral would be to risk receiving a gunshot\r\n'b'without being able to return it. But do you not think that the best\r\n'b'thing to be done now is to openly give chase to these wretches?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is just what I was thinking,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cI believe we\xe2\x80\x99re\r\n'b'not fellows to be afraid of a bullet, and as for me, if Captain Harding\r\n'b'approves, I\xe2\x80\x99m ready to dash into the forest! Why, hang it, one man is\r\n'b'equal to another!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut is he equal to five?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will join Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand both of us, well-armed\r\n'b'and accompanied by Top--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy dear Spilett, and you, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding, \xe2\x80\x9clet us reason\r\n'b'coolly. If the convicts were hid in one spot of the island, if we knew\r\n'b'that spot, and had only to dislodge them, I would undertake a direct\r\n'b'attack; but is there not occasion to fear, on the contrary, that they\r\n'b'are sure to fire the first shot?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9ca bullet does not always reach its\r\n'b'mark.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat which struck Herbert did not miss, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\n'b'engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cBesides, observe that if both of you left the corral I should\r\n'b'remain here alone to defend it. Do you imagine that the convicts will\r\n'b'not see you leave it, that they will not allow you to enter the forest,\r\n'b'and that they will not attack it during your absence, knowing that there\r\n'b'is no one here but a wounded boy and a man?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, his chest swelling with\r\n'b'sullen anger. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are right; they will do all they can to retake the\r\n'b'corral, which they know to be well stored; and alone you could not hold\r\n'b'it against them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, if we were only at Granite House!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we were at Granite House,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cthe case would be\r\n'b'very different. There I should not be afraid to leave Herbert with one,\r\n'b'while the other three went to search the forests of the island. But we\r\n'b'are at the corral, and it is best to stay here until we can leave it\r\n'b'together.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s reasoning was unanswerable, and his companions\r\n'b'understood it well.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf only Ayrton was still one of us!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cPoor fellow!\r\n'b'his return to social life will have been but of short duration.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf he is dead,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft, in a peculiar tone.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo you hope, then, Pencroft, that the villains have spared him?\xe2\x80\x9d asked\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, if they had any interest in doing so.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat! you suppose that Ayrton finding his old companions, forgetting\r\n'b'all that he owes us--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor, who did not hazard this shameful\r\n'b'supposition without hesitating.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding, taking the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s arm, \xe2\x80\x9cthat is a wicked\r\n'b'idea of yours, and you will distress me much if you persist in speaking\r\n'b'thus. I will answer for Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s fidelity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd I also,\xe2\x80\x9d added the reporter quickly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, yes, captain, I was wrong,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft; \xe2\x80\x9cit was a wicked\r\n'b'idea indeed that I had, and nothing justifies it. But what can I do? I\xe2\x80\x99m\r\n'b'not in my senses. This imprisonment in the corral wearies me horribly,\r\n'b'and I have never felt so excited as I do now.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBe patient, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cHow long will it be, my\r\n'b'dear Spilett, before you think Herbert may be carried to Granite House?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is difficult to say, Cyrus,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cfor any\r\n'b'imprudence might involve terrible consequences. But his convalescence\r\n'b'is progressing, and if he continues to gain strength, in eight days from\r\n'b'now--well, we shall see.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Eight days! That would put off the return to Granite House until the\r\n'b'first days of December. At this time two months of spring had already\r\n'b'passed. The weather was fine, and the heat began to be great. The\r\n'b'forests of the island were in full leaf, and the time was approaching\r\n'b'when the usual crops ought to be gathered. The return to the plateau of\r\n'b'Prospect Heights would, therefore, be followed by extensive agricultural\r\n'b'labors, interrupted only by the projected expedition through the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It can, therefore, be well understood how injurious this seclusion in\r\n'b'the corral must have been to the colonists.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But if they were compelled to bow before necessity, they did not do so\r\n'b'without impatience.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Once or twice the reporter ventured out into the road and made the\r\n'b'tour of the palisade. Top accompanied him, and Gideon Spilett, his gun\r\n'b'cocked, was ready for any emergency.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He met with no misadventure and found no suspicious traces. His dog\r\n'b'would have warned him of any danger, and, as Top did not bark, it might\r\n'b'be concluded that there was nothing to fear at the moment at least, and\r\n'b'that the convicts were occupied in another part of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, on his second sortie, on the 27th of November, Gideon Spilett,\r\n'b'who had ventured a quarter of a mile into the woods, towards the south\r\n'b'of the mountain, remarked that Top scented something. The dog had no\r\n'b'longer his unconcerned manner; he went backwards and forwards, ferreting\r\n'b'among the grass and bushes as if his smell had revealed some suspicious\r\n'b'object to him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett followed Top, encouraged him, excited him by his voice,\r\n'b'while keeping a sharp look-out, his gun ready to fire, and sheltering\r\n'b'himself behind the trees. It was not probable that Top scented the\r\n'b'presence of man, for in that case, he would have announced it by\r\n'b'half-uttered, sullen, angry barks. Now, as he did not growl, it was\r\n'b'because danger was neither near nor approaching.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nearly five minutes passed thus, Top rummaging, the reporter following\r\n'b'him prudently when, all at once, the dog rushed towards a thick bush,\r\n'b'and drew out a rag.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was a piece of cloth, stained and torn, which Spilett immediately\r\n'b'brought back to the corral. There it was examined by the colonists,\r\n'b'who found that it was a fragment of Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s waistcoat, a piece of that\r\n'b'felt, manufactured solely by the Granite House factory.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou see, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cthere has been resistance on the\r\n'b'part of the unfortunate Ayrton. The convicts have dragged him away in\r\n'b'spite of himself! Do you still doubt his honesty?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cand I repented of my suspicion a\r\n'b'long time ago! But it seems to me that something may be learned from the\r\n'b'incident.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is that?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is that Ayrton was not killed at the corral! That they dragged him\r\n'b'away living, since he has resisted. Therefore, perhaps, he is still\r\n'b'living!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps, indeed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, who remained thoughtful.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was a hope, to which Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s companions could still hold. Indeed,\r\n'b'they had before believed that, surprised in the corral, Ayrton had\r\n'b'fallen by a bullet, as Herbert had fallen. But if the convicts had not\r\n'b'killed him at first, if they had brought him living to another part of\r\n'b'the island, might it not be admitted that he was still their prisoner?\r\n'b'Perhaps, even, one of them had found in Ayrton his old Australian\r\n'b'companion Ben Joyce, the chief of the escaped convicts. And who knows\r\n'b'but that they had conceived the impossible hope of bringing back Ayrton\r\n'b'to themselves? He would have been very useful to them, if they had been\r\n'b'able to make him turn traitor!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This incident was, therefore, favorably interpreted at the corral, and\r\n'b'it no longer appeared impossible that they should find Ayrton again.\r\n'b'On his side, if he was only a prisoner, Ayrton would no doubt do all\r\n'b'he could to escape from the hands of the villains, and this would be a\r\n'b'powerful aid to the settlers!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt any rate,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cif happily Ayrton did manage to\r\n'b'escape, he would go directly to Granite House, for he could not know\r\n'b'of the attempted assassination of which Herbert has been a victim, and\r\n'b'consequently would never think of our being imprisoned in the corral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh! I wish that he was there, at Granite House!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand\r\n'b'that we were there, too! For, although the rascals can do nothing to our\r\n'b'house, they may plunder the plateau, our plantations, our poultry-yard!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft had become a thorough farmer, heartily attached to his crops.\r\n'b'But it must be said that Herbert was more anxious than any to return\r\n'b'to Granite House, for he knew how much the presence of the settlers\r\n'b'was needed there. And it was he who was keeping them at the corral!\r\n'b'Therefore, one idea occupied his mind--to leave the corral, and when!\r\n'b'He believed he could bear removal to Granite House. He was sure his\r\n'b'strength would return more quickly in his room, with the air and sight\r\n'b'of the sea!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Several times he pressed Gideon Spilett, but the latter, fearing, with\r\n'b'good reason, that Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s wounds, half healed, might reopen on the\r\n'b'way, did not give the order to start.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, something occurred which compelled Cyrus Harding and his\r\n'b'two friends to yield to the lad\xe2\x80\x99s wish, and God alone knew that this\r\n'b'determination might cause them grief and remorse.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the 29th of November, seven o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the evening. The three\r\n'b'settlers were talking in Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s room, when they heard Top utter quick\r\n'b'barks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding, Pencroft, and Spilett seized their guns and ran out of the\r\n'b'house. Top, at the foot of the palisade, was jumping, barking, but it\r\n'b'was with pleasure, not anger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome one is coming.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not an enemy!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNeb, perhaps?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOr Ayrton?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These words had hardly been exchanged between the engineer and his two\r\n'b'companions when a body leaped over the palisade and fell on the ground\r\n'b'inside the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was Jup, Master Jup in person, to whom Top immediately gave a most\r\n'b'cordial reception.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJup!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNeb has sent him to us,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9che must have some note on him.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft rushed up to the orang. Certainly if Neb had any important\r\n'b'matter to communicate to his master he could not employ a more sure or\r\n'b'more rapid messenger, who could pass where neither the colonists could,\r\n'b'nor even Top himself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding was not mistaken. At Jup\xe2\x80\x99s neck hung a small bag, and in\r\n'b'this bag was found a little note traced by Neb\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The despair of Harding and his companions may be imagined when they read\r\n'b'these words:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFriday, six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPlateau invaded by convicts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'                             \xe2\x80\x9cNeb.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They gazed at each other without uttering a word, then they re-entered\r\n'b'the house. What were they to do? The convicts on Prospect Heights! that\r\n'b'was disaster, devastation, ruin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert, on seeing the engineer, the reporter, and Pencroft re-enter,\r\n'b'guessed that their situation was aggravated, and when he saw Jup, he no\r\n'b'longer doubted that some misfortune menaced Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cI must go; I can bear the journey. I must\r\n'b'go.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett approached Herbert; then, having looked at him,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us go, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The question was quickly decided whether Herbert should be carried on a\r\n'b'litter or in the cart which had brought Ayrton to the corral. The motion\r\n'b'of the litter would have been more easy for the wounded lad, but it\r\n'b'would have necessitated two bearers, that is to say, there would have\r\n'b'been two guns less for defense if an attack was made on the road. Would\r\n'b'they not, on the contrary, by employing the cart leave every arm free?\r\n'b'Was it impossible to place the mattress on which Herbert was lying in\r\n'b'it, and to advance with so much care that any jolt should be avoided? It\r\n'b'could be done.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cart was brought. Pencroft harnessed the onager. Cyrus Harding and\r\n'b'the reporter raised Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s mattress and placed it on the bottom of\r\n'b'the cart. The weather was fine. The sun\xe2\x80\x99s bright rays glanced through\r\n'b'the trees.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre the guns ready?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were. The engineer and Pencroft, each armed with a double-barreled\r\n'b'gun, and Gideon Spilett carrying his rifle, had nothing to do but start.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you comfortable, Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the lad, \xe2\x80\x9cdon\xe2\x80\x99t be uneasy, I shall not die on the\r\n'b'road!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While speaking thus, it could be seen that the poor boy had called up\r\n'b'all his energy, and by the energy of a powerful will had collected his\r\n'b'failing strength.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer felt his heart sink painfully. He still hesitated to\r\n'b'give the signal for departure; but that would have driven Herbert to\r\n'b'despair--killed him perhaps.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The gate of the corral was opened. Jup and Top, who knew when to be\r\n'b'silent, ran in advance. The cart came out, the gate was reclosed, and\r\n'b'the onager, led by Pencroft, advanced at a slow pace.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Certainly, it would have been safer to have taken a different road than\r\n'b'that which led straight from the corral to Granite House, but the cart\r\n'b'would have met with great difficulties in moving under the trees. It was\r\n'b'necessary, therefore, to follow this way, although it was well known to\r\n'b'the convicts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett walked one on each side of the cart,\r\n'b'ready to answer to any attack. However, it was not probable that the\r\n'b'convicts would have yet left the plateau of Prospect Heights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb\xe2\x80\x99s note had evidently been written and sent as soon as the convicts\r\n'b'had shown themselves there. Now, this note was dated six o\xe2\x80\x99clock in\r\n'b'the morning, and the active orang, accustomed to come frequently to the\r\n'b'corral, had taken scarcely three quarters of an hour to cross the five\r\n'b'miles which separated it from Granite House. They would, therefore, be\r\n'b'safe at that time, and if there was any occasion for firing, it would\r\n'b'probably not be until they were in the neighborhood of Granite House.\r\n'b'However, the colonists kept a strict watch. Top and Jup, the latter\r\n'b'armed with his club, sometimes in front, sometimes beating the wood at\r\n'b'the sides of the road, signalized no danger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cart advanced slowly under Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s guidance. It had left the\r\n'b'corral at half-past seven. An hour after, four out of the five miles\r\n'b'had been cleared, without any incident having occurred. The road was\r\n'b'as deserted as all that part of the Jacamar Wood which lay between the\r\n'b'Mercy and the lake. There was no occasion for any warning. The wood\r\n'b'appeared as deserted as on the day when the colonists first landed on\r\n'b'the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They approached the plateau. Another mile and they would see the bridge\r\n'b'over Creek Glycerine. Cyrus Harding expected to find it in its place;\r\n'b'supposing that the convicts would have crossed it, and that, after\r\n'b'having passed one of the streams which enclosed the plateau, they\r\n'b'would have taken the precaution to lower it again, so as to keep open a\r\n'b'retreat.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At length an opening in the trees allowed the sea-horizon to be seen.\r\n'b'But the cart continued its progress, for not one of its defenders\r\n'b'thought of abandoning it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment Pencroft stopped the onager, and in a hoarse voice,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh! the villains!\xe2\x80\x9d he exclaimed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And he pointed to a thick smoke rising from the mill, the sheds, and the\r\n'b'buildings at the poultry-yard.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A man was moving about in the midst of the smoke. It was Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His companions uttered a shout. He heard, and ran to meet them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The convicts had left the plateau nearly half-an-hour before, having\r\n'b'devastated it!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd Mr. Herbert?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett returned to the cart.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert had lost consciousness!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 10\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Of the convicts, the dangers which menaced Granite House, the ruins\r\n'b'with which the plateau was covered, the colonists thought no longer.\r\n'b'Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s critical state outweighed all other considerations. Would the\r\n'b'removal prove fatal to him by causing some internal injury? The reporter\r\n'b'could not affirm it, but he and his companions almost despaired of\r\n'b'the result. The cart was brought to the bend of the river. There some\r\n'b'branches, disposed as a liner, received the mattress on which lay the\r\n'b'unconscious Herbert. Ten minutes after, Cyrus Harding, Spilett, and\r\n'b'Pencroft were at the foot of the cliff, leaving Neb to take the cart\r\n'b'on to the plateau of Prospect Heights. The lift was put in motion, and\r\n'b'Herbert was soon stretched on his bed in Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What cares were lavished on him to bring him back to life! He smiled for\r\n'b'a moment on finding himself in his room, but could scarcely even murmur\r\n'b'a few words, so great was his weakness. Gideon Spilett examined his\r\n'b'wounds. He feared to find them reopened, having been imperfectly healed.\r\n'b'There was nothing of the sort. From whence, then, came this prostration?\r\n'b'why was Herbert so much worse? The lad then fell into a kind of feverish\r\n'b'sleep, and the reporter and Pencroft remained near the bed. During this\r\n'b'time, Harding told Neb all that had happened at the corral, and Neb\r\n'b'recounted to his master the events of which the plateau had just been\r\n'b'the theater.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was only during the preceding night that the convicts had appeared on\r\n'b'the edge of the forest, at the approaches to Creek Glycerine. Neb, who\r\n'b'was watching near the poultry-yard, had not hesitated to fire at one of\r\n'b'the pirates, who was about to cross the stream; but in the darkness he\r\n'b'could not tell whether the man had been hit or not. At any rate, it was\r\n'b'not enough to frighten away the band, and Neb had only just time to get\r\n'b'up to Granite House, where at least he was in safety.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But what was he to do there? How prevent the devastations with which the\r\n'b'convicts threatened the plateau? Had Neb any means by which to warn\r\n'b'his master? And, besides, in what situation were the inhabitants of the\r\n'b'corral themselves? Cyrus Harding and his companions had left on the 11th\r\n'b'of November, and it was now the 29th. It was, therefore, nineteen days\r\n'b'since Neb had had other news than that brought by Top--disastrous news:\r\n'b'Ayrton disappeared, Herbert severely wounded, the engineer, reporter,\r\n'b'and sailor, as it were, imprisoned in the corral!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What was he to do? asked poor Neb. Personally he had nothing to\r\n'b'fear, for the convicts could not reach him in Granite House. But the\r\n'b'buildings, the plantations, all their arrangements at the mercy of the\r\n'b'pirates! Would it not be best to let Cyrus Harding judge of what he\r\n'b'ought to do, and to warn him, at least, of the danger which threatened\r\n'b'him?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb then thought of employing Jup, and confiding a note to him. He knew\r\n'b'the orang\xe2\x80\x99s great intelligence, which had been often put to the proof.\r\n'b'Jup understood the word corral, which had been frequently pronounced\r\n'b'before him, and it may be remembered, too, that he had often driven\r\n'b'the cart thither in company with Pencroft. Day had not yet dawned. The\r\n'b'active orang would know how to pass unperceived through the woods, of\r\n'b'which the convicts, besides, would think he was a native.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb did not hesitate. He wrote the note, he tied it to Jup\xe2\x80\x99s neck, he\r\n'b'brought the ape to the door of Granite House, from which he let down a\r\n'b'long cord to the ground; then, several times he repeated these words,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJup Jup! corral, corral!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The creature understood, seized the cord, glided rapidly down the beach,\r\n'b'and disappeared in the darkness without the convicts\xe2\x80\x99 attention having\r\n'b'been in the least excited.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou did well, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cbut perhaps in not warning us you\r\n'b'would have done still better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, in speaking thus, Cyrus Harding thought of Herbert, whose recovery\r\n'b'the removal had so seriously checked.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb ended his account. The convicts had not appeared at all on the\r\n'b'beach. Not knowing the number of the island\xe2\x80\x99s inhabitants, they might\r\n'b'suppose that Granite House was defended by a large party. They must have\r\n'b'remembered that during the attack by the brig numerous shot had been\r\n'b'fired both from the lower and upper rocks, and no doubt they did not\r\n'b'wish to expose themselves. But the plateau of Prospect Heights was\r\n'b'open to them, and not covered by the fire of Granite House. They gave\r\n'b'themselves up, therefore, to their instinct of destruction,--plundering,\r\n'b'burning, devastating everything,--and only retiring half an hour before\r\n'b'the arrival of the colonists, whom they believed still confined in the\r\n'b'corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On their retreat, Neb hurried out. He climbed the plateau at the risk\r\n'b'of being perceived and fired at, tried to extinguish the fire which was\r\n'b'consuming the buildings of the poultry-yard, and had struggled, though\r\n'b'in vain, against it until the cart appeared at the edge of the wood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Such had been these serious events. The presence of the convicts\r\n'b'constituted a permanent source of danger to the settlers in Lincoln\r\n'b'Island, until then so happy, and who might now expect still greater\r\n'b'misfortunes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Spilett remained in Granite House with Herbert and Pencroft, while\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, accompanied by Neb, proceeded to judge for himself of the\r\n'b'extent of the disaster.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was fortunate that the convicts had not advanced to the foot of\r\n'b'Granite House. The workshop at the Chimneys would in that case not\r\n'b'have escaped destruction. But after all, this evil would have been more\r\n'b'easily reparable than the ruins accumulated on the plateau of Prospect\r\n'b'Heights. Harding and Neb proceeded towards the Mercy, and ascended its\r\n'b'left bank without meeting with any trace of the convicts; nor on the\r\n'b'other side of the river, in the depths of the wood, could they perceive\r\n'b'any suspicious indications.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Besides, it might be supposed that in all probability either the\r\n'b'convicts knew of the return of the settlers to Granite House, by having\r\n'b'seen them pass on the road from the corral, or, after the devastation of\r\n'b'the plateau, they had penetrated into Jacamar Wood, following the course\r\n'b'of the Mercy, and were thus ignorant of their return.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the former case, they must have returned towards the corral, now\r\n'b'without defenders, and which contained valuable stores.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the latter, they must have regained their encampment, and would wait\r\n'b'on opportunity to recommence the attack.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was, therefore, possible to prevent them, but any enterprise to clear\r\n'b'the island was now rendered difficult by reason of Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s condition.\r\n'b'Indeed, their whole force would have been barely sufficient to cope with\r\n'b'the convicts, and just now no one could leave Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer and Neb arrived on the plateau. Desolation reigned\r\n'b'everywhere. The fields had been trampled over; the ears of wheat, which\r\n'b'were nearly full-grown, lay on the ground. The other plantations had not\r\n'b'suffered less.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The kitchen-garden was destroyed. Happily, Granite House possessed a\r\n'b'store of seed which would enable them to repair these misfortunes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the wall and buildings of the poultry-yard and the onagers stable,\r\n'b'the fire had destroyed all. A few terrified creatures roamed over the\r\n'b'plateau. The birds, which during the fire had taken refuge on the waters\r\n'b'of the lake, had already returned to their accustomed spot, and were\r\n'b'dabbling on the banks. Everything would have to be reconstructed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s face, which was paler than usual, expressed an internal\r\n'b'anger which he commanded with difficulty, but he did not utter a word.\r\n'b'Once more he looked at his devastated fields, and at the smoke which\r\n'b'still rose from the ruins, then he returned to Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The following days were the saddest of any that the colonists had passed\r\n'b'on the island! Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s weakness visibly increased. It appeared that\r\n'b'a more serious malady, the consequence of the profound physiological\r\n'b'disturbance he had gone through, threatened to declare itself, and\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett feared such an aggravation of his condition that he would\r\n'b'be powerless to fight against it!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, Herbert remained in an almost continuous state of drowsiness,\r\n'b'and symptoms of delirium began to manifest themselves. Refreshing drinks\r\n'b'were the only remedies at the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 disposal. The fever was not\r\n'b'as yet very high, but it soon appeared that it would probably recur at\r\n'b'regular intervals. Gideon Spilett first recognized this on the 6th of\r\n'b'December.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The poor boy, whose fingers, nose, and ears had become extremely\r\n'b'pale, was at first seized with slight shiverings, horripilations, and\r\n'b'tremblings. His pulse was weak and irregular, his skin dry, his thirst\r\n'b'intense. To this soon succeeded a hot fit; his face became flushed; his\r\n'b'skin reddened; his pulse quick; then a profuse perspiration broke out\r\n'b'after which the fever seemed to diminish. The attack had lasted nearly\r\n'b'five hours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett had not left Herbert, who, it was only too certain, was\r\n'b'now seized by an intermittent fever, and this fever must be cured at any\r\n'b'cost before it should assume a more serious aspect.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd in order to cure it,\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett to Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwe need a\r\n'b'febrifuge.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA febrifuge--\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cWe have neither Peruvian bark,\r\n'b'nor sulphate of quinine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there are willows on the border of\r\n'b'the lake, and the bark of the willow might, perhaps, prove to be a\r\n'b'substitute for quinine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us try it without losing a moment,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The bark of the willow has, indeed, been justly considered as a\r\n'b'succedaneum for Peruvian bark, as has also that of the horse-chestnut\r\n'b'tree, the leaf of the holly, the snake-root, etc. It was evidently\r\n'b'necessary to make trial of this substance, although not so valuable as\r\n'b'Peruvian bark, and to employ it in its natural state, since they had no\r\n'b'means for extracting its essence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding went himself to cut from the trunk of a species of black\r\n'b'willow, a few pieces of bark; he brought them back to Granite House, and\r\n'b'reduced them to a powder, which was administered that same evening to\r\n'b'Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night passed without any important change. Herbert was somewhat\r\n'b'delirious, but the fever did not reappear in the night, and did not\r\n'b'return either during the following day.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft again began to hope. Gideon Spilett said nothing. It might be\r\n'b'that the fever was not quotidian, but tertian, and that it would return\r\n'b'next day. Therefore, he awaited the next day with the greatest anxiety.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It might have been remarked besides that during this period Herbert\r\n'b'remained utterly prostrate, his head weak and giddy. Another symptom\r\n'b'alarmed the reporter to the highest degree. Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s liver became\r\n'b'congested, and soon a more intense delirium showed that his brain was\r\n'b'also affected.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett was overwhelmed by this new complication. He took the\r\n'b'engineer aside.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is a malignant fever,\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA malignant fever!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cYou are mistaken, Spilett. A\r\n'b'malignant fever does not declare itself spontaneously; its germ must\r\n'b'previously have existed.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cHerbert no doubt contracted\r\n'b'the germ of this fever in the marshes of the island. He has already had\r\n'b'one attack; should a second come on and should we not be able to prevent\r\n'b'a third, he is lost.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut the willow bark?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is insufficient,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand the third attack of\r\n'b'a malignant fever, which is not arrested by means of quinine, is always\r\n'b'fatal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Fortunately, Pencroft heard nothing of this conversation or he would\r\n'b'have gone mad.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It may be imagined what anxiety the engineer and the reporter suffered\r\n'b'during the day of the 7th of December and the following night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards the middle of the day the second attack came on. The crisis was\r\n'b'terrible. Herbert felt himself sinking. He stretched his arms towards\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, towards Spilett, towards Pencroft. He was so young to\r\n'b'die! The scene was heart-rending. They were obliged to send Pencroft\r\n'b'away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The fit lasted five hours. It was evident that Herbert could not survive\r\n'b'a third.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night was frightful. In his delirium Herbert uttered words which\r\n'b'went to the hearts of his companions. He struggled with the convicts,\r\n'b'he called to Ayrton, he poured forth entreaties to that mysterious\r\n'b'being,--that powerful unknown protector,--whose image was stamped upon\r\n'b'his mind; then he again fell into a deep exhaustion which completely\r\n'b'prostrated him. Several times Gideon Spilett thought that the poor boy\r\n'b'was dead.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 8th of December, was but a succession of the fainting\r\n'b'fits. Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s thin hands clutched the sheets. They had administered\r\n'b'further doses of pounded bark, but the reporter expected no result from\r\n'b'it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf before tomorrow morning we have not given him a more energetic\r\n'b'febrifuge,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cHerbert will be dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Night arrived--the last night, it was too much to be feared, of the\r\n'b'good, brave, intelligent boy, so far in advance of his years, and who\r\n'b'was loved by all as their own child. The only remedy which existed\r\n'b'against this terrible malignant fever, the only specific which could\r\n'b'overcome it, was not to be found in Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the night of the 8th of December, Herbert was seized by a more\r\n'b'violent delirium. His liver was fearfully congested, his brain affected,\r\n'b'and already it was impossible for him to recognize any one.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Would he live until the next day, until that third attack which\r\n'b'must infallibly carry him off? It was not probable. His strength was\r\n'b'exhausted, and in the intervals of fever he lay as one dead.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards three o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning Herbert uttered a piercing cry.\r\n'b'He seemed to be torn by a supreme convulsion. Neb, who was near him,\r\n'b'terrified, ran into the next room where his companions were watching.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top, at that moment, barked in a strange manner.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All rushed in immediately and managed to restrain the dying boy, who was\r\n'b'endeavoring to throw himself out of his bed, while Spilett, taking his\r\n'b'arm, felt his pulse gradually quicken.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was five in the morning. The rays of the rising sun began to shine in\r\n'b'at the windows of Granite House. It promised to be a fine day, and this\r\n'b'day was to be poor Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s last!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A ray glanced on the table placed near the bed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Suddenly Pencroft, uttering a cry, pointed to the table.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On it lay a little oblong box, of which the cover bore these\r\n'b'words:--\xe2\x80\x9cSULPHATE OF QUININE.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 11\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett took the box and opened it. It contained nearly two\r\n'b'hundred grains of a white powder, a few particles of which he carried to\r\n'b'his lips. The extreme bitterness of the substance precluded all doubt;\r\n'b'it was certainly the precious extract of quinine, that pre-eminent\r\n'b'antifebrile.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This powder must be administered to Herbert without delay. How it came\r\n'b'there might be discussed later.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSome coffee!\xe2\x80\x9d said Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few moments Neb brought a cup of the warm infusion. Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'threw into it about eighteen grains of quinine, and they succeeded in\r\n'b'making Herbert drink the mixture.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was still time, for the third attack of the malignant fever had\r\n'b'not yet shown itself. How they longed to be able to add that it would\r\n'b'not return!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Besides, it must be remarked, the hopes of all had now revived. The\r\n'b'mysterious influence had been again exerted, and in a critical moment,\r\n'b'when they had despaired of it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few hours Herbert was much calmer. The colonists could now discuss\r\n'b'this incident. The intervention of the stranger was more evident than\r\n'b'ever. But how had he been able to penetrate during the night into\r\n'b'Granite House? It was inexplicable, and, in truth, the proceedings of\r\n'b'the genius of the island were not less mysterious than was that genius\r\n'b'himself. During this day the sulphate of quinine was administered to\r\n'b'Herbert every three hours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day some improvement in Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s condition was apparent.\r\n'b'Certainly, he was not out of danger, intermittent fevers being subject\r\n'b'to frequent and dangerous relapses, but the most assiduous care was\r\n'b'bestowed on him. And besides, the specific was at hand; nor, doubtless,\r\n'b'was he who had brought it far distant! And the hearts of all were\r\n'b'animated by returning hope.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This hope was not disappointed. Ten days after, on the 20th of December,\r\n'b'Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s convalescence commenced.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He was still weak, and strict diet had been imposed upon him, but no\r\n'b'access of fever supervened. And then, the poor boy submitted with such\r\n'b'docility to all the prescriptions ordered him! He longed so to get well!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft was as a man who has been drawn up from the bottom of an abyss.\r\n'b'Fits of joy approaching delirium seized him. When the time for the third\r\n'b'attack had passed by, he nearly suffocated the reporter in his embrace.\r\n'b'Since then, he always called him Dr. Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The real doctor, however, remained undiscovered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe will find him!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated the sailor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Certainly, this man, whoever he was, might expect a somewhat too\r\n'b'energetic embrace from the worthy Pencroft!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The month of December ended, and with it the year 1867, during which\r\n'b'the colonists of Lincoln Island had of late been so severely tried.\r\n'b'They commenced the year 1868 with magnificent weather, great heat, and\r\n'b'a tropical temperature, delightfully cooled by the sea-breeze. Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'recovery progressed, and from his bed, placed near one of the windows of\r\n'b'Granite House, he could inhale the fresh air, charged with ozone, which\r\n'b'could not fail to restore his health. His appetite returned, and what\r\n'b'numberless delicate, savory little dishes Neb prepared for him!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough to make one wish to have a fever oneself!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During all this time, the convicts did not once appear in the vicinity\r\n'b'of Granite House. There was no news of Ayrton, and though the engineer\r\n'b'and Herbert still had some hopes of finding him again, their companions\r\n'b'did not doubt but that the unfortunate man had perished. However, this\r\n'b'uncertainty could not last, and when once the lad should have recovered,\r\n'b'the expedition, the result of which must be so important, would be\r\n'b'undertaken. But they would have to wait a month, perhaps, for all\r\n'b'the strength of the colony must be put into requisition to obtain\r\n'b'satisfaction from the convicts.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s convalescence progressed rapidly. The congestion of\r\n'b'the liver had disappeared, and his wounds might be considered completely\r\n'b'healed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the month of January, important work was done on the plateau\r\n'b'of Prospect Heights; but it consisted solely in saving as much as was\r\n'b'possible from the devastated crops, either of corn or vegetables. The\r\n'b'grain and the plants were gathered, so as to provide a new harvest for\r\n'b'the approaching half-season. With regard to rebuilding the poultry-yard,\r\n'b'wall, or stables, Cyrus Harding preferred to wait. While he and his\r\n'b'companions were in pursuit of the convicts, the latter might very\r\n'b'probably pay another visit to the plateau, and it would be useless to\r\n'b'give them an opportunity of recommencing their work of destruction. When\r\n'b'the island should be cleared of these miscreants, they would set about\r\n'b'rebuilding. The young convalescent began to get up in the second week of\r\n'b'January, at first for one hour a day, then two, then three. His strength\r\n'b'visibly returned, so vigorous was his constitution. He was now eighteen\r\n'b'years of age. He was tall, and promised to become a man of noble and\r\n'b'commanding presence. From this time his recovery, while still requiring\r\n'b'care,--and Dr. Spilett was very strict,--made rapid progress. Towards\r\n'b'the end of the month, Herbert was already walking about on Prospect\r\n'b'Heights, and the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He derived, from several sea-baths, which he took in company with\r\n'b'Pencroft and Neb, the greatest possible benefit. Cyrus Harding thought\r\n'b'he might now settle the day for their departure, for which the 15th of\r\n'b'February was fixed. The nights, very clear at this time of year, would\r\n'b'be favorable to the researches they intended to make all over the\r\n'b'island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The necessary preparations for this exploration were now commenced, and\r\n'b'were important, for the colonists had sworn not to return to Granite\r\n'b'House until their twofold object had been achieved; on the one hand, to\r\n'b'exterminate the convicts, and rescue Ayrton, if he was still living; on\r\n'b'the other, to discover who it was that presided so effectually over the\r\n'b'fortunes of the colony.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Of Lincoln Island, the settlers knew thoroughly all the eastern coast\r\n'b'from Claw Cape to the Mandible Capes, the extensive Tadorn Marsh, the\r\n'b'neighborhood of Lake Grant, Jacamar Wood, between the road to the corral\r\n'b'and the Mercy, the courses of the Mercy and Red Creek, and lastly, the\r\n'b'spurs of Mount Franklin, among which the corral had been established.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had explored, though only in an imperfect manner, the vast shore\r\n'b'of Washington Bay from Claw Cape to Reptile End, the woody and marshy\r\n'b'border of the west coast, and the interminable downs, ending at the open\r\n'b'mouth of Shark Gulf. But they had in no way surveyed the woods which\r\n'b'covered the Serpentine Peninsula, all to the right of the Mercy, the\r\n'b'left bank of Falls River, and the wilderness of spurs and valleys which\r\n'b'supported three quarters of the base of Mount Franklin, to the east, the\r\n'b'north, and the west, and where doubtless many secret retreats existed.\r\n'b'Consequently, many millions of acres of the island had still escaped\r\n'b'their investigations.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was, therefore, decided that the expedition should be carried through\r\n'b'the Far West, so as to include all that region situated on the right of\r\n'b'the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It might, perhaps, be better worth while to go direct to the corral,\r\n'b'where it might be supposed that the convicts had again taken refuge,\r\n'b'either to pillage or to establish themselves there. But either the\r\n'b'devastation of the corral would have been an accomplished fact by\r\n'b'this time, and it would be too late to prevent it, or it had been the\r\n'b'convicts\xe2\x80\x99 interest to entrench themselves there, and there would be\r\n'b'still time to go and turn them out on their return.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Therefore, after some discussion, the first plan was adhered to, and the\r\n'b'settlers resolved to proceed through the wood to Reptile End. They would\r\n'b'make their way with their hatchets, and thus lay the first draft of a\r\n'b'road which would place Granite House in communication with the end of\r\n'b'the peninsula for a length of from sixteen to seventeen miles.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cart was in good condition. The onagers, well rested, could go a\r\n'b'long journey. Provisions, camp effects, a portable stove, and various\r\n'b'utensils were packed in the cart, as also weapons and ammunition,\r\n'b'carefully chosen from the now complete arsenal of Granite House. But it\r\n'b'was necessary to remember that the convicts were, perhaps, roaming about\r\n'b'the woods, and that in the midst of these thick forests a shot might\r\n'b'quickly be fired and received. It was therefore resolved that the little\r\n'b'band of settlers should remain together and not separate under any\r\n'b'pretext whatever.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was also decided that no one should remain at Granite House. Top\r\n'b'and Jup themselves were to accompany the expedition; the inaccessible\r\n'b'dwelling needed no guard. The 14th of February, eve of the departure,\r\n'b'was consecrated entirely to repose, and--thanksgiving addressed by the\r\n'b'colonists to the Creator. A place in the cart was reserved for Herbert,\r\n'b'who, though thoroughly convalescent, was still a little weak. The next\r\n'b'morning, at daybreak, Cyrus Harding took the necessary measures to\r\n'b'protect Granite House from any invasion. The ladders, which were\r\n'b'formerly used for the ascent, were brought to the Chimneys and buried\r\n'b'deep in the sand, so that they might be available on the return of the\r\n'b'colonists, for the machinery of the lift had been taken to pieces, and\r\n'b'nothing of the apparatus remained. Pencroft stayed the last in Granite\r\n'b'House in order to finish this work, and he then lowered himself down\r\n'b'by means of a double rope held below, and which, when once hauled down,\r\n'b'left no communication between the upper landing and the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The weather was magnificent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall have a warm day of it,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, laughing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPooh! Dr. Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall walk under the shade\r\n'b'of the trees and shan\xe2\x80\x99t even see the sun!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cart was waiting on the beach before the Chimneys. The reporter\r\n'b'made Herbert take his place in it during the first hours at least of the\r\n'b'journey, and the lad was obliged to submit to his doctor\xe2\x80\x99s orders.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb placed himself at the onagers\xe2\x80\x99 heads. Cyrus Harding, the reporter,\r\n'b'and the sailor, walked in front. Top bounded joyfully along. Herbert\r\n'b'offered a seat in his vehicle to Jup, who accepted it without ceremony.\r\n'b'The moment for departure had arrived, and the little band set out.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cart first turned the angle of the mouth of the Mercy, then, having\r\n'b'ascended the left bank for a mile, crossed the bridge, at the other side\r\n'b'of which commenced the road to Port Balloon, and there the explorers,\r\n'b'leaving this road on their left, entered the cover of the immense woods\r\n'b'which formed the region of the Far West.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For the first two miles the widely scattered trees allowed the cart to\r\n'b'pass with ease; from time to time it became necessary to cut away a few\r\n'b'creepers and bushes, but no serious obstacle impeded the progress of the\r\n'b'colonists.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The thick foliage of the trees threw a grateful shade on the ground.\r\n'b'Deodars, Douglas firs, casuarinas, banksias, gum-trees, dragon-trees,\r\n'b'and other well-known species, succeeded each other far as the eye could\r\n'b'reach. The feathered tribes of the island were all represented--grouse,\r\n'b'jacamars, pheasants, lories, as well as the chattering cockatoos,\r\n'b'parrots, and paroquets. Agouties, kangaroos, and capybaras fled swiftly\r\n'b'at their approach; and all this reminded the settlers of the first\r\n'b'excursions they had made on their arrival at the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cI notice that these creatures,\r\n'b'both birds and quadrupeds, are more timid than formerly. These woods\r\n'b'have, therefore, been recently traversed by the convicts, and we shall\r\n'b'certainly find some traces of them.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, in fact, in several places they could distinguish traces, more or\r\n'b'less recent, of the passage of a band of men--here branches broken off\r\n'b'the trees, perhaps to mark out the way; there the ashes of a fire, and\r\n'b'footprints in clayey spots; but nothing which appeared to belong to a\r\n'b'settled encampment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer had recommended his companions to refrain from hunting. The\r\n'b'reports of the firearms might give the alarm to the convicts, who\r\n'b'were, perhaps, roaming through the forest. Moreover, the hunters would\r\n'b'necessarily ramble some distance from the cart, which it was dangerous\r\n'b'to leave unguarded.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the afterpart of the day, when about six miles from Granite House,\r\n'b'their progress became much more difficult. In order to make their way\r\n'b'through some thickets, they were obliged to cut down trees. Before\r\n'b'entering such places Harding was careful to send in Top and Jup, who\r\n'b'faithfully accomplished their commission, and when the dog and orang\r\n'b'returned without giving any warning, there was evidently nothing to\r\n'b'fear, either from convicts or wild beasts, two varieties of the animal\r\n'b'kingdom, whose ferocious instincts placed them on the same level. On the\r\n'b'evening of the first day the colonists encamped about nine miles from\r\n'b'Granite House, on the border of a little stream falling into the Mercy,\r\n'b'and of the existence of which they had till then been ignorant; it\r\n'b'evidently, however, belonged to the hydiographical system to which the\r\n'b'soil owed its astonishing fertility. The settlers made a hearty meal,\r\n'b'for their appetites were sharpened, and measures were then taken that\r\n'b'the night might be passed in safety. If the engineer had had only to\r\n'b'deal with wild beasts, jaguars or others, he would have simply lighted\r\n'b'fires all around his camp, which would have sufficed for its defense;\r\n'b'but the convicts would be rather attracted than terrified by the flames,\r\n'b'and it was, therefore, better to be surrounded by the profound darkness\r\n'b'of night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The watch was, however, carefully organized. Two of the settlers were\r\n'b'to watch together, and every two hours it was agreed that they should\r\n'b'be relieved by their comrades. And so, notwithstanding his wish to the\r\n'b'contrary, Herbert was exempted from guard. Pencroft and Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'in one party, the engineer and Neb in another, mounted guard in turns\r\n'b'over the camp.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night, however, was but of few hours. The darkness was due rather to\r\n'b'the thickness of the foliage than to the disappearance of the sun.\r\n'b'The silence was scarcely disturbed by the howling of jaguars and the\r\n'b'chattering of the monkeys, the latter appearing to particularly irritate\r\n'b'Master Jup. The night passed without incident, and on the next day, the\r\n'b'15th of February, the journey through the forest, tedious rather than\r\n'b'difficult, was continued. This day they could not accomplish more than\r\n'b'six miles, for every moment they were obliged to cut a road with their\r\n'b'hatchets.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Like true settlers, the colonists spared the largest and most beautiful\r\n'b'trees, which would besides have cost immense labor to fell, and the\r\n'b'small ones only were sacrificed, but the result was that the road took a\r\n'b'very winding direction, and lengthened itself by numerous detours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the day Herbert discovered several new specimens not before met\r\n'b'with in the island, such as the tree-fern, with its leaves spread out\r\n'b'like the waters of a fountain, locust-trees, on the long pods of\r\n'b'which the onagers browsed greedily, and which supplied a sweet pulp\r\n'b'of excellent flavor. There, too, the colonists again found groups of\r\n'b'magnificent kauries, their cylindrical trunks, crowded with a cone\r\n'b'of verdure, rising to a height of two hundred feet. These were the\r\n'b'tree-kings of New Zealand, as celebrated as the cedars of Lebanon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the fauna, there was no addition to those species already known to\r\n'b'the hunters. Nevertheless, they saw, though unable to get near them, a\r\n'b'couple of those large birds peculiar to Australia, a sort of cassowary,\r\n'b'called emu, five feet in height, and with brown plumage, which belong\r\n'b'to the tribe of waders. Top darted after them as fast as his four legs\r\n'b'could carry him, but the emus distanced him with ease, so prodigious was\r\n'b'their speed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As to the traces left by the convicts, a few more were discovered. Some\r\n'b'footprints found near an apparently recently extinguished fire were\r\n'b'attentively examined by the settlers. By measuring them one after the\r\n'b'other, according to their length and breadth, the marks of five men\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'feet were easily distinguished. The five convicts had evidently\r\n'b'camped on this spot; but,--and this was the object of so minute an\r\n'b'examination,--a sixth footprint could not be discovered, which in that\r\n'b'case would have been that of Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton was not with them!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand if he was not with them, it was because\r\n'b'the wretches had already murdered him! but then these rascals have not a\r\n'b'den to which they may be tracked like tigers!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cit is more probable that they wander at\r\n'b'random, and it is their interest to rove about until the time when they\r\n'b'will be masters of the island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe masters of the island!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cthe masters of the\r\n'b'island!...\xe2\x80\x9d he repeated, and his voice was choked, as if his throat was\r\n'b'seized in an iron grasp. Then in a calmer tone, \xe2\x80\x9cDo you know, Captain\r\n'b'Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat the ball is which I have rammed into my gun?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is the ball that went through Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s chest, and I promise you it\r\n'b'won\xe2\x80\x99t miss its mark!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But this just retaliation would not bring Ayrton back to life, and from\r\n'b'the examination of the footprints left in the ground, they must, alas!\r\n'b'conclude that all hopes of ever seeing him again must be abandoned.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That evening they encamped fourteen miles from Granite House, and Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding calculated that they could not be more than five miles from\r\n'b'Reptile Point.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And indeed, the next day the extremity of the peninsula was reached, and\r\n'b'the whole length of the forest had been traversed; but there was nothing\r\n'b'to indicate the retreat in which the convicts had taken refuge, nor\r\n'b'that, no less secret, which sheltered the mysterious unknown.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 12\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 18th of February, was devoted to the exploration\r\n'b'of all that wooded region forming the shore from Reptile End to Falls\r\n'b'River. The colonists were able to search this forest thoroughly, for, as\r\n'b'it was comprised between the two shores of the Serpentine Peninsula, it\r\n'b'was only from three to four miles in breadth. The trees, both by their\r\n'b'height and their thick foliage, bore witness to the vegetative power of\r\n'b'the soil, more astonishing here than in any other part of the island.\r\n'b'One might have said that a corner from the virgin forests of America or\r\n'b'Africa had been transported into this temperate zone. This led them to\r\n'b'conclude that the superb vegetation found a heat in this soil, damp in\r\n'b'its upper layer, but warmed in the interior by volcanic fires, which\r\n'b'could not belong to a temperate climate. The most frequently occurring\r\n'b'trees were knaries and eucalypti of gigantic dimensions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 object was not simply to admire the magnificent\r\n'b'vegetation. They knew already that in this respect Lincoln Island would\r\n'b'have been worthy to take the first rank in the Canary group, to which\r\n'b'the first name given was that of the Happy Isles. Now, alas! their\r\n'b'island no longer belonged to them entirely; others had taken possession\r\n'b'of it, miscreants polluted its shores, and they must be destroyed to the\r\n'b'last man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No traces were found on the western coast, although they were carefully\r\n'b'sought for. No more footprints, no more broken branches, no more\r\n'b'deserted camps.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis does not surprise me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding to his companions.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe convicts first landed on the island in the neighborhood of Flotsam\r\n'b'Point, and they immediately plunged into the Far West forests, after\r\n'b'crossing Tadorn Marsh. They then followed almost the same route that we\r\n'b'took on leaving Granite House. This explains the traces we found in the\r\n'b'wood. But, arriving on the shore, the convicts saw at once that they\r\n'b'would discover no suitable retreat there, and it was then that, going\r\n'b'northwards again, they came upon the corral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere they have perhaps returned,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cfor they would naturally\r\n'b'suppose that our researches would be in that direction. The corral is\r\n'b'only a storehouse to them, and not a definitive encampment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am of Cyrus\xe2\x80\x99 opinion,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand I think that it is\r\n'b'among the spurs of Mount Franklin that the convicts will have made their\r\n'b'lair.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen, captain, straight to the corral!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must finish\r\n'b'them off, and till now we have only lost time!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my friend,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cyou forget that we have a reason\r\n'b'for wishing to know if the forests of the Far West do not contain some\r\n'b'habitation. Our exploration has a double object, Pencroft. If, on the\r\n'b'one hand, we have to chastise crime, we have, on the other, an act of\r\n'b'gratitude to perform.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was well said, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut, all the same,\r\n'b'it is my opinion that we shall not find the gentleman until he pleases.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And truly Pencroft only expressed the opinion of all. It was probable\r\n'b'that the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s retreat was not less mysterious than was he himself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'That evening the cart halted at the mouth of Falls River. The camp was\r\n'b'organized as usual, and the customary precautions were taken for the\r\n'b'night. Herbert, become again the healthy and vigorous lad he was before\r\n'b'his illness, derived great benefit from this life in the open air,\r\n'b'between the sea breezes and the vivifying air from the forests. His\r\n'b'place was no longer in the cart, but at the head of the troop.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 19th of February, the colonists, leaving the shore,\r\n'b'where, beyond the mouth, basalts of every shape were so picturesquely\r\n'b'piled up, ascended the river by its left bank. The road had been already\r\n'b'partly cleared in their former excursions made from the corral to the\r\n'b'west coast. The settlers were now about six miles from Mount Franklin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s plan was this:--To minutely survey the valley forming\r\n'b'the bed of the river, and to cautiously approach the neighborhood of the\r\n'b'corral; if the corral was occupied, to seize it by force; if it was not,\r\n'b'to entrench themselves there and make it the center of the operations\r\n'b'which had for their object the exploration of Mount Franklin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This plan was unanimously approved by the colonists, for they were\r\n'b'impatient to regain entire possession of their island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They made their way then along the narrow valley separating two of the\r\n'b'largest spurs of Mount Franklin. The trees, crowded on the river\xe2\x80\x99s bank,\r\n'b'became rare on the upper slopes of the mountain. The ground was hilly\r\n'b'and rough, very suitable for ambushes, and over which they did not\r\n'b'venture without extreme precaution. Top and Jup skirmished on the\r\n'b'flanks, springing right and left through the thick brushwood, and\r\n'b'emulating each other in intelligence and activity. But nothing showed\r\n'b'that the banks of the stream had been recently frequented--nothing\r\n'b'announced either the presence or the proximity of the convicts. Towards\r\n'b'five in the evening the cart stopped nearly 600 feet from the palisade.\r\n'b'A semicircular screen of trees still hid it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was necessary to reconnoiter the corral, in order to ascertain if it\r\n'b'was occupied. To go there openly, in broad daylight, when the convicts\r\n'b'were probably in ambush, would be to expose themselves, as poor Herbert\r\n'b'had done, to the firearms of the ruffians. It was better, then, to wait\r\n'b'until night came on.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, Gideon Spilett wished without further delay to reconnoiter the\r\n'b'approaches to the corral, and Pencroft, who was quite out of patience,\r\n'b'volunteered to accompany him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwait till night. I will not allow\r\n'b'one of you to expose himself in open day.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, captain--\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor, little disposed to obey.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI beg of you, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well!\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, who vented his anger in another way, by\r\n'b'bestowing on the convicts the worst names in his maritime vocabulary.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists remained, therefore, near the cart, and carefully watched\r\n'b'the neighboring parts of the forest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Three hours passed thus. The wind had fallen, and absolute silence\r\n'b'reigned under the great trees. The snapping of the smallest twig, a\r\n'b'footstep on the dry leaves, the gliding of a body among the grass, would\r\n'b'have been heard without difficulty. All was quiet. Besides, Top, lying\r\n'b'on the grass, his head stretched out on his paws, gave no sign of\r\n'b'uneasiness. At eight o\xe2\x80\x99clock the day appeared far enough advanced for\r\n'b'the reconnaissance to be made under favorable conditions. Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'declared himself ready to set out accompanied by Pencroft. Cyrus Harding\r\n'b'consented. Top and Jup were to remain with the engineer, Herbert, and\r\n'b'Neb, for a bark or a cry at a wrong moment would give the alarm.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo not be imprudent,\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding to the reporter and Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cyou\r\n'b'have not to gain possession of the corral, but only to find out whether\r\n'b'it is occupied or not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAll right,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the two departed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Under the trees, thanks to the thickness of their foliage, the obscurity\r\n'b'rendered any object invisible beyond a radius of from thirty to forty\r\n'b'feet. The reporter and Pencroft, halting at any suspicious sound,\r\n'b'advanced with great caution.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They walked a little distance apart from each other so as to offer a\r\n'b'less mark for a shot. And, to tell the truth, they expected every moment\r\n'b'to hear a report. Five minutes after leaving the cart, Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'and Pencroft arrived at the edge of the wood before the clearing beyond\r\n'b'which rose the palisade.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They stopped. A few straggling beams still fell on the field clear of\r\n'b'trees. Thirty feet distant was the gate of the corral, which appeared\r\n'b'to be closed. This thirty feet, which it was necessary to cross from\r\n'b'the wood to the palisade, constituted the dangerous zone, to borrow\r\n'b'a ballistic term: in fact, one or more bullets fired from behind the\r\n'b'palisade might knock over any one who ventured on to this zone. Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett and the sailor were not men to draw back, but they knew that\r\n'b'any imprudence on their part, of which they would be the first victims,\r\n'b'would fall afterwards on their companions. If they themselves were\r\n'b'killed, what would become of Harding, Neb, and Herbert?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But Pencroft, excited at feeling himself so near the corral where he\r\n'b'supposed the convicts had taken refuge, was about to press forward, when\r\n'b'the reporter held him back with a grasp of iron.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn a few minutes it will be quite dark,\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Spilett in the\r\n'b'sailor\xe2\x80\x99s ear, \xe2\x80\x9cthen will be the time to act.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, convulsively clasping the butt-end of his gun, restrained his\r\n'b'energies, and waited, swearing to himself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Soon the last of the twilight faded away. Darkness, which seemed as if\r\n'b'it issued from the dense forest, covered the clearing. Mount Franklin\r\n'b'rose like an enormous screen before the western horizon, and night\r\n'b'spread rapidly over all, as it does in regions of low latitudes. Now was\r\n'b'the time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter and Pencroft, since posting themselves on the edge of the\r\n'b'wood, had not once lost sight of the palisade. The corral appeared to\r\n'b'be absolutely deserted. The top of the palisade formed a line, a\r\n'b'little darker than the surrounding shadow, and nothing disturbed its\r\n'b'distinctness. Nevertheless, if the convicts were there, they must have\r\n'b'posted one of their number to guard against any surprise.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Spilett grasped his companion\xe2\x80\x99s hand, and both crept towards the corral,\r\n'b'their guns ready to fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They reached the gate without the darkness being illuminated by a single\r\n'b'ray of light.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft tried to push open the gate, which, as the reporter and he had\r\n'b'supposed, was closed. However, the sailor was able to ascertain that the\r\n'b'outer bars had not been put up. It might, then, be concluded that the\r\n'b'convicts were there in the corral, and that very probably they had\r\n'b'fastened the gate in such a way that it could not be forced open.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett and Pencroft listened.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Not a sound could be heard inside the palisade. The musmons and the\r\n'b'goats, sleeping no doubt in their huts, in no way disturbed the calm of\r\n'b'night.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter and the sailor hearing nothing, asked themselves whether\r\n'b'they had not better scale the palisades and penetrate into the corral.\r\n'b'This would have been contrary to Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s instructions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It is true that the enterprise might succeed, but it might also fail.\r\n'b'Now, if the convicts were suspecting nothing, if they knew nothing of\r\n'b'the expedition against them, if, lastly, there now existed a chance\r\n'b'of surprising them, ought this chance to be lost by inconsiderately\r\n'b'attempting to cross the palisades?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This was not the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s opinion. He thought it better to wait until\r\n'b'all the settlers were collected together before attempting to penetrate\r\n'b'into the corral. One thing was certain, that it was possible to reach\r\n'b'the palisade without being seen, and also that it did not appear to be\r\n'b'guarded. This point settled, there was nothing to be done but to return\r\n'b'to the cart, where they would consult.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft probably agreed with this decision, for he followed the\r\n'b'reporter without making any objection when the latter turned back to the\r\n'b'wood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few minutes the engineer was made acquainted with the state of\r\n'b'affairs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, after a little thought, \xe2\x80\x9cI now have reason to believe\r\n'b'that the convicts are not in the corral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall soon know,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen we have scaled the palisade.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo the corral, my friends!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShall we leave the cart in the wood?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cit is our wagon of ammunition and\r\n'b'provisions, and, if necessary, it would serve as an entrenchment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForward, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The cart emerged from the wood and began to roll noiselessly towards the\r\n'b'palisade. The darkness was now profound, the silence as complete as\r\n'b'when Pencroft and the reporter crept over the ground. The thick grass\r\n'b'completely muffled their footsteps. The colonists held themselves ready\r\n'b'to fire. Jup, at Pencroft\xe2\x80\x99s orders, kept behind. Neb led Top in a leash,\r\n'b'to prevent him from bounding forward.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The clearing soon came in sight. It was deserted. Without hesitating,\r\n'b'the little band moved towards the palisade. In a short space of time the\r\n'b'dangerous zone was passed. Neb remained at the onagers\xe2\x80\x99 heads to hold\r\n'b'them. The engineer, the reporter, Herbert, and Pencroft, proceeded to\r\n'b'the door, in order to ascertain if it was barricaded inside. It was\r\n'b'open!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you say now?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer, turning to the sailor and\r\n'b'Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Both were stupefied.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI can swear,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat this gate was shut just now!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists now hesitated. Were the convicts in the corral when\r\n'b'Pencroft and the reporter made their reconnaissance? It could not be\r\n'b'doubted, as the gate then closed could only have been opened by them.\r\n'b'Were they still there, or had one of their number just gone out?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All these questions presented themselves simultaneously to the minds of\r\n'b'the colonists, but how could they be answered?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment, Herbert, who had advanced a few steps into the\r\n'b'enclosure, drew back hurriedly, and seized Harding\xe2\x80\x99s hand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat\xe2\x80\x99s the matter?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA light!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the house?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All five advanced and indeed, through the window fronting them, they saw\r\n'b'glimmering a feeble light. Cyrus Harding made up his mind rapidly. \xe2\x80\x9cIt\r\n'b'is our only chance,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to his companions, \xe2\x80\x9cof finding the convicts\r\n'b'collected in this house, suspecting nothing! They are in our power!\r\n'b'Forward!\xe2\x80\x9d The colonists crossed through the enclosure, holding their\r\n'b'guns ready in their hands. The cart had been left outside under the\r\n'b'charge of Jup and Top, who had been prudently tied to it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Gideon Spilett on one side, Herbert and Neb\r\n'b'on the other, going along by the palisade, surveyed the absolutely dark\r\n'b'and deserted corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few moments they were near the closed door of the house.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding signed to his companions not to stir, and approached the window,\r\n'b'then feebly lighted by the inner light.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He gazed into the apartment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the table burned a lantern. Near the table was the bed formerly used\r\n'b'by Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the bed lay the body of a man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Suddenly Cyrus Harding drew back, and in a hoarse voice,--\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton!\xe2\x80\x9d he\r\n'b'exclaimed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Immediately the door was forced rather than opened, and the colonists\r\n'b'rushed into the room.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton appeared to be asleep. His countenance showed that he had long\r\n'b'and cruelly suffered. On his wrists and ankles could be seen great\r\n'b'bruises.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding bent over him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton!\xe2\x80\x9d cried the engineer, seizing the arm of the man whom he had\r\n'b'just found again under such unexpected circumstances.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this exclamation Ayrton opened his eyes, and, gazing at Harding, then\r\n'b'at the others,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9cyou?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton! Ayrton!\xe2\x80\x9d repeated Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhere am I?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the house in the corral!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlone?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut they will come back!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ayrton. \xe2\x80\x9cDefend yourselves! defend\r\n'b'yourselves!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And he fell back exhausted.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSpilett,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe may be attacked at any moment.\r\n'b'Bring the cart into the corral. Then, barricade the door, and all come\r\n'b'back here.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft, Neb, and the reporter hastened to execute the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'orders. There was not a moment to be lost. Perhaps even now the cart was\r\n'b'in the hands of the convicts!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a moment the reporter and his two companions had crossed the corral\r\n'b'and reached the gate of the palisade behind which Top was heard growling\r\n'b'sullenly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer, leaving Ayrton for an instant, came out ready to fire.\r\n'b'Herbert was at his side. Both surveyed the crest of the spur overlooking\r\n'b'the corral. If the convicts were lying in ambush there, they might knock\r\n'b'the settlers over one after the other.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment the moon appeared in the east, above the black curtain of\r\n'b'the forest, and a white sheet of light spread over the interior of the\r\n'b'enclosure. The corral, with its clumps of trees, the little stream which\r\n'b'watered it, its wide carpet of grass, was suddenly illuminated. From\r\n'b'the side of the mountain, the house and a part of the palisade stood\r\n'b'out white in the moonlight. On the opposite side towards the door, the\r\n'b'enclosure remained dark. A black mass soon appeared. This was the cart\r\n'b'entering the circle of light, and Cyrus Harding could hear the noise\r\n'b'made by the door, as his companions shut it and fastened the interior\r\n'b'bars.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But, at that moment, Top, breaking loose, began to bark furiously and\r\n'b'rush to the back of the corral, to the right of the house.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBe ready to fire, my friends!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists raised their pieces and waited the moment to fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Top still barked, and Jup, running towards the dog, uttered shrill\r\n'b'cries.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists followed him, and reached the borders of the little\r\n'b'stream, shaded by large trees. And there, in the bright moonlight, what\r\n'b'did they see? Five corpses, stretched on the bank!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They were those of the convicts who, four months previously, had landed\r\n'b'on Lincoln Island!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 13\r\n'b'\r\n'b'How had it happened? who had killed the convicts? Was it Ayrton? No, for\r\n'b'a moment before he was dreading their return.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But Ayrton was now in a profound stupor, from which it was no longer\r\n'b'possible to rouse him. After uttering those few words he had again\r\n'b'become unconscious, and had fallen back motionless on the bed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists, a prey to a thousand confused thoughts, under the\r\n'b'influence of violent excitement, waited all night, without leaving\r\n'b'Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s house, or returning to the spot where lay the bodies of the\r\n'b'convicts. It was very probable that Ayrton would not be able to throw\r\n'b'any light on the circumstances under which the bodies had been found,\r\n'b'since he himself was not aware that he was in the corral. But at any\r\n'b'rate he would be in a position to give an account of what had taken\r\n'b'place before this terrible execution. The next day Ayrton awoke from his\r\n'b'torpor, and his companions cordially manifested all the joy they felt,\r\n'b'on seeing him again, almost safe and sound, after a hundred and four\r\n'b'days separation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton then in a few words recounted what had happened, or, at least, as\r\n'b'much as he knew.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The day after his arrival at the corral, on the 10th of last November,\r\n'b'at nightfall, he was surprised by the convicts, who had scaled the\r\n'b'palisade. They bound and gagged him; then he was led to a dark cavern,\r\n'b'at the foot of Mount Franklin, where the convicts had taken refuge.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His death had been decided upon, and the next day the convicts were\r\n'b'about to kill him, when one of them recognized him and called him by\r\n'b'the name which he bore in Australia. The wretches had no scruples as to\r\n'b'murdering Ayrton! They spared Ben Joyce!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But from that moment Ayrton was exposed to the importunities of his\r\n'b'former accomplices. They wished him to join them again, and relied upon\r\n'b'his aid to enable them to gain possession of Granite House, to penetrate\r\n'b'into that hitherto inaccessible dwelling, and to become masters of the\r\n'b'island, after murdering the colonists!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton remained firm. The once convict, now repentant and pardoned,\r\n'b'would rather die than betray his companions. Ayrton--bound, gagged, and\r\n'b'closely watched--lived in this cave for four months.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nevertheless the convicts had discovered the corral a short time after\r\n'b'their arrival in the island, and since then they had subsisted on\r\n'b'Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s stores, but did not live at the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 11th of November, two of the villains, surprised by the\r\n'b'colonists\xe2\x80\x99 arrival, fired at Herbert, and one of them returned, boasting\r\n'b'of having killed one of the inhabitants of the island; but he returned\r\n'b'alone. His companion, as is known, fell by Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s dagger.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s anxiety and despair may be imagined when he learned the news of\r\n'b'Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s death. The settlers were now only four, and, as it seemed,\r\n'b'at the mercy of the convicts. After this event, and during all the\r\n'b'time that the colonists, detained by Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s illness, remained in the\r\n'b'corral, the pirates did not leave their cavern, and even after they had\r\n'b'pillaged the plateau of Prospect Heights, they did not think it prudent\r\n'b'to abandon it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The ill-treatment inflicted on Ayrton was now redoubled. His hands and\r\n'b'feet still bore the bloody marks of the cords which bound him day and\r\n'b'night. Every moment he expected to be put to death, nor did it appear\r\n'b'possible that he could escape.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Matters remained thus until the third week of February. The convicts,\r\n'b'still watching for a favorable opportunity, rarely quitted their\r\n'b'retreat, and only made a few hunting excursions, either to the interior\r\n'b'of the island, or the south coast.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton had no further news of his friends, and relinquished all hope\r\n'b'of ever seeing them again. At last, the unfortunate man, weakened\r\n'b'by ill-treatment, fell into a prostration so profound that sight and\r\n'b'hearing failed him. From that moment, that is to say, since the last two\r\n'b'days, he could give no information whatever of what had occurred.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9csince I was imprisoned in that\r\n'b'cavern, how is it that I find myself in the corral?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow is it that the convicts are lying yonder dead, in the middle of the\r\n'b'enclosure?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDead!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Ayrton, half rising from his bed, notwithstanding his\r\n'b'weakness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His companions supported him. He wished to get up, and with their\r\n'b'assistance he did so. They then proceeded together towards the little\r\n'b'stream.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now broad daylight.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There, on the bank, in the position in which they had been stricken\r\n'b'by death in its most instantaneous form, lay the corpses of the five\r\n'b'convicts!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton was astounded. Harding and his companions looked at him without\r\n'b'uttering a word. On a sign from the engineer, Neb and Pencroft examined\r\n'b'the bodies, already stiffened by the cold.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They bore no apparent trace of any wound.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Only, after carefully examining them, Pencroft found on the forehead of\r\n'b'one, on the chest of another, on the back of this one, on the shoulder\r\n'b'of that, a little red spot, a sort of scarcely visible bruise, the cause\r\n'b'of which it was impossible to conjecture.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is there that they have been struck!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut with what weapon?\xe2\x80\x9d cried the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA weapon, lightning-like in its effects, and of which we have not the\r\n'b'secret!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd who has struck the blow?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe avenging power of the island,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9che who brought you\r\n'b'here, Ayrton, whose influence has once more manifested itself, who does\r\n'b'for us all that which we cannot do for ourselves, and who, his will\r\n'b'accomplished, conceals himself from us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us make search for him, then!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, we will search for him,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cbut we shall not\r\n'b'discover this powerful being who performs such wonders, until he pleases\r\n'b'to call us to him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This invisible protection, which rendered their own action unavailing,\r\n'b'both irritated and piqued the engineer. The relative inferiority which\r\n'b'it proved was of a nature to wound a haughty spirit. A generosity\r\n'b'evinced in such a manner as to elude all tokens of gratitude, implied a\r\n'b'sort of disdain for those on whom the obligation was conferred, which in\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s eyes marred, in some degree, the worth of the benefit.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us search,\xe2\x80\x9d he resumed, \xe2\x80\x9cand God grant that we may some day be\r\n'b'permitted to prove to this haughty protector that he has not to deal\r\n'b'with ungrateful people! What would I not give could we repay him, by\r\n'b'rendering him in our turn, although at the price of our lives, some\r\n'b'signal service!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From this day, the thoughts of the inhabitants of Lincoln Island were\r\n'b'solely occupied with the intended search. Everything incited them to\r\n'b'discover the answer to this enigma, an answer which would only be the\r\n'b'name of a man endowed with a truly inexplicable, and in some degree\r\n'b'superhuman power.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a few minutes, the settlers re-entered the house, where their\r\n'b'influence soon restored to Ayrton his moral and physical energy. Neb\r\n'b'and Pencroft carried the corpses of the convicts into the forest, some\r\n'b'distance from the corral, and buried them deep in the ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton was then made acquainted with the facts which had occurred during\r\n'b'his seclusion. He learned Herbert\xe2\x80\x99s adventures, and through what various\r\n'b'trials the colonists had passed. As to the settlers, they had despaired\r\n'b'of ever seeing Ayrton again, and had been convinced that the convicts\r\n'b'had ruthlessly murdered him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd now,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, as he ended his recital, \xe2\x80\x9ca duty remains\r\n'b'for us to perform. Half of our task is accomplished, but although the\r\n'b'convicts are no longer to be feared, it is not owing to ourselves that\r\n'b'we are once more masters of the island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9clet us search all this labyrinth of\r\n'b'the spurs of Mount Franklin. We will not leave a hollow, not a hole\r\n'b'unexplored! Ah! if ever a reporter found himself face to face with a\r\n'b'mystery, it is I who now speak to you, my friends!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we will not return to Granite House until we have found our\r\n'b'benefactor,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will do all that it is humanly possible to\r\n'b'do, but I repeat we shall not find him until he himself permits us.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cShall we stay at the corral?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall stay here,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cProvisions are abundant, and we\r\n'b'are here in the very center of the circle we have to explore. Besides,\r\n'b'if necessary, the cart will take us rapidly to Granite House.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cOnly I have a remark to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat is it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHere is the fine season getting on, and we must not forget that we have\r\n'b'a voyage to make.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA voyage?\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, to Tabor Island,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cIt is necessary to carry a\r\n'b'notice there to point out the position of our island and say that Ayrton\r\n'b'is here in case the Scotch yacht should come to take him off. Who knows\r\n'b'if it is not already too late?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Ayrton, \xe2\x80\x9chow do you intend to make this voyage?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn the \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ayrton. \xe2\x80\x9cShe no longer exists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 exists no longer!\xe2\x80\x9d shouted Pencroft, bounding from\r\n'b'his seat.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ayrton. \xe2\x80\x9cThe convicts discovered her in her little harbor\r\n'b'only eight days ago, they put to sea in her--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, his heart beating.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd not having Bob Harvey to steer her, they ran on the rocks, and the\r\n'b'vessel went to pieces.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, the villains, the cutthroats, the infamous scoundrels!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed\r\n'b'Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, taking the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s hand, \xe2\x80\x9cwe will build\r\n'b'another \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99--a larger one. We have all the ironwork--all the\r\n'b'rigging of the brig at our disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you know,\xe2\x80\x9d returned Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthat it will take at least five\r\n'b'or six months to build a vessel of from thirty to forty tons?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe can take our time,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cand we must give up the\r\n'b'voyage to Tabor Island for this year.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOh, my \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure!\xe2\x80\x99 my poor \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure!\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, almost\r\n'b'broken-hearted at the destruction of the vessel of which he was so\r\n'b'proud.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The loss of the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d was certainly a thing to be lamented by\r\n'b'the colonists, and it was agreed that this loss should be repaired\r\n'b'as soon as possible. This settled, they now occupied themselves with\r\n'b'bringing their researches to bear on the most secret parts of the\r\n'b'island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The exploration was commenced at daybreak on the 19th of February, and\r\n'b'lasted an entire week. The base of the mountain, with its spurs and\r\n'b'their numberless ramifications, formed a labyrinth of valleys and\r\n'b'elevations. It was evident that there, in the depths of these narrow\r\n'b'gorges, perhaps even in the interior of Mount Franklin itself, was the\r\n'b'proper place to pursue their researches. No part of the island could\r\n'b'have been more suitable to conceal a dwelling whose occupant wished to\r\n'b'remain unknown. But so irregular was the formation of the valleys that\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding was obliged to conduct the exploration in a strictly\r\n'b'methodical manner.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists first visited the valley opening to the south of the\r\n'b'volcano, and which first received the waters of Falls River. There\r\n'b'Ayrton showed them the cavern where the convicts had taken refuge, and\r\n'b'in which he had been imprisoned until his removal to the corral. This\r\n'b'cavern was just as Ayrton had left it. They found there a considerable\r\n'b'quantity of ammunition and provisions, conveyed thither by the convicts\r\n'b'in order to form a reserve.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The whole of the valley bordering on the cave, shaded by fir and\r\n'b'other trees, was thoroughly explored, and on turning the point of the\r\n'b'southwestern spur, the colonists entered a narrower gorge similar to the\r\n'b'picturesque columns of basalt on the coast. Here the trees were fewer.\r\n'b'Stones took the place of grass. Goats and musmons gambolled among the\r\n'b'rocks. Here began the barren part of the island. It could already be\r\n'b'seen that, of the numerous valleys branching off at the base of Mount\r\n'b'Franklin, three only were wooded and rich in pasturage like that of the\r\n'b'corral, which bordered on the west on the Falls River valley, and on the\r\n'b'east on the Red Creek valley. These two streams, which lower down became\r\n'b'rivers by the absorption of several tributaries, were formed by all the\r\n'b'springs of the mountain and thus caused the fertility of its southern\r\n'b'part. As to the Mercy, it was more directly fed from ample springs\r\n'b'concealed under the cover of Jacamar Wood, and it was by springs of\r\n'b'this nature, spreading in a thousand streamlets, that the soil of the\r\n'b'Serpentine Peninsula was watered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Now, of these three well-watered valleys, either might have served as a\r\n'b'retreat to some solitary who would have found there everything necessary\r\n'b'for life. But the settlers had already explored them, and in no part had\r\n'b'they discovered the presence of man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Was it then in the depths of those barren gorges, in the midst of the\r\n'b'piles of rock, in the rugged northern ravines, among the streams of\r\n'b'lava, that this dwelling and its occupant would be found?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The northern part of Mount Franklin was at its base composed solely of\r\n'b'two valleys, wide, not very deep, without any appearance of vegetation,\r\n'b'strewn with masses of rock, paved with lava, and varied with great\r\n'b'blocks of mineral. This region required a long and careful exploration.\r\n'b'It contained a thousand cavities, comfortless no doubt, but perfectly\r\n'b'concealed and difficult of access.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists even visited dark tunnels, dating from the volcanic\r\n'b'period, still black from the passage of the fire, and penetrated into\r\n'b'the depths of the mountain. They traversed these somber galleries,\r\n'b'waving lighted torches; they examined the smallest excavations; they\r\n'b'sounded the shallowest depths, but all was dark and silent. It did\r\n'b'not appear that the foot of man had ever before trodden these ancient\r\n'b'passages, or that his arm had ever displaced one of these blocks, which\r\n'b'remained as the volcano had cast them up above the waters, at the time\r\n'b'of the submersion of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, although these passages appeared to be absolutely deserted, and\r\n'b'the obscurity was complete, Cyrus Harding was obliged to confess that\r\n'b'absolute silence did not reign there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On arriving at the end of one of these gloomy caverns, extending several\r\n'b'hundred feet into the interior of the mountain, he was surprised to hear\r\n'b'a deep rumbling noise, increased in intensity by the sonorousness of the\r\n'b'rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett, who accompanied him, also heard these distant\r\n'b'mutterings, which indicated a revivification of the subterranean fires.\r\n'b'Several times both listened, and they agreed that some chemical process\r\n'b'was taking place in the bowels of the earth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen the volcano is not totally extinct?\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is possible that since our exploration of the crater,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding, \xe2\x80\x9csome change has occurred. Any volcano, although considered\r\n'b'extinct, may evidently again burst forth.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut if an eruption of Mount Franklin occurred,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cwould\r\n'b'there not be some danger to Lincoln Island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do not think so,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe crater, that is to\r\n'b'say, the safety-valve, exists, and the overflow of smoke and lava, would\r\n'b'escape, as it did formerly, by this customary outlet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnless the lava opened a new way for itself towards the fertile parts\r\n'b'of the island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd why, my dear Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cshould it not\r\n'b'follow the road naturally traced out for it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, volcanoes are capricious,\xe2\x80\x9d returned the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNotice,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the inclination of Mount Franklin\r\n'b'favors the flow of water towards the valleys which we are exploring just\r\n'b'now. To turn aside this flow, an earthquake would be necessary to change\r\n'b'the mountain\xe2\x80\x99s center of gravity.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut an earthquake is always to be feared at these times,\xe2\x80\x9d observed\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAlways,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cespecially when the subterranean forces\r\n'b'begin to awake, as they risk meeting with some obstruction, after a long\r\n'b'rest. Thus, my dear Spilett, an eruption would be a serious thing\r\n'b'for us, and it would be better that the volcano should not have the\r\n'b'slightest desire to wake up. But we could not prevent it, could we? At\r\n'b'any rate, even if it should occur, I do not think Prospect Heights would\r\n'b'be seriously threatened. Between them and the mountain, the ground\r\n'b'is considerably depressed, and if the lava should ever take a course\r\n'b'towards the lake, it would be cast on the downs and the neighboring\r\n'b'parts of Shark Gulf.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have not yet seen any smoke at the top of the mountain, to indicate\r\n'b'an approaching eruption,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cnot a vapor escapes from the crater, for it\r\n'b'was only yesterday that I attentively surveyed the summit. But it\r\n'b'is probable that at the lower part of the chimney, time may have\r\n'b'accumulated rocks, cinders, hardened lava, and that this valve of which\r\n'b'I spoke, may at any time become overcharged. But at the first serious\r\n'b'effort, every obstacle will disappear, and you may be certain, my dear\r\n'b'Spilett, that neither the island, which is the boiler, nor the\r\n'b'volcano, which is the chimney, will burst under the pressure of gas.\r\n'b'Nevertheless, I repeat, it would be better that there should not be an\r\n'b'eruption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet we are not mistaken,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cMutterings can be\r\n'b'distinctly heard in the very bowels of the volcano!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, again listening attentively. \xe2\x80\x9cThere\r\n'b'can be no doubt of it. A commotion is going on there, of which we can\r\n'b'neither estimate the importance nor the ultimate result.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Spilett, on coming out, rejoined their companions, to\r\n'b'whom they made known the state of affairs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cVery well!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cThe volcano wants to play his pranks! Let\r\n'b'him try, if he likes! He will find his master!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur good genius, Neb, our good genius, who will shut his mouth for him,\r\n'b'if he so much as pretends to open it!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As may be seen, the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s confidence in the tutelary deity of his\r\n'b'island was absolute, and, certainly, the occult power, manifested until\r\n'b'now in so many inexplicable ways, appeared to be unlimited; but also it\r\n'b'knew how to escape the colonists\xe2\x80\x99 most minute researches, for, in\r\n'b'spite of all their efforts, in spite of the more than zeal,--the\r\n'b'obstinacy,--with which they carried on their exploration, the retreat of\r\n'b'the mysterious being could not be discovered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From the 19th to the 20th of February the circle of investigation was\r\n'b'extended to all the northern region of Lincoln Island, whose most secret\r\n'b'nooks were explored. The colonists even went the length of tapping every\r\n'b'rock. The search was extended to the extreme verge of the mountain. It\r\n'b'was explored thus to the very summit of the truncated cone terminating\r\n'b'the first row of rocks, then to the upper ridge of the enormous hat, at\r\n'b'the bottom of which opened the crater.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They did more; they visited the gulf, now extinct, but in whose depths\r\n'b'the rumbling could be distinctly heard. However, no sign of smoke or\r\n'b'vapor, no heating of the rock, indicated an approaching eruption.\r\n'b'But neither there, nor in any other part of Mount Franklin, did the\r\n'b'colonists find any traces of him of whom they were in search.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their investigations were then directed to the downs. They carefully\r\n'b'examined the high lava-cliffs of Shark Gulf from the base to the crest,\r\n'b'although it was extremely difficult to reach even the level of the gulf.\r\n'b'No one!--nothing!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Indeed, in these three words was summed up so much fatigue uselessly\r\n'b'expended, so much energy producing no results, that somewhat of anger\r\n'b'mingled with the discomfiture of Cyrus Harding and his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now time to think of returning, for these researches could not be\r\n'b'prolonged indefinitely. The colonists were certainly right in believing\r\n'b'that the mysterious being did not reside on the surface of the island,\r\n'b'and the wildest fancies haunted their excited imaginations. Pencroft\r\n'b'and Neb, particularly, were not contented with the mystery, but allowed\r\n'b'their imaginations to wander into the domain of the supernatural.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 25th of February the colonists re-entered Granite House, and by\r\n'b'means of the double cord, carried by an arrow to the threshold of the\r\n'b'door, they re-established communication between their habitation and the\r\n'b'ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A month later they commemorated, on the 25th of March, the third\r\n'b'anniversary of their arrival on Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 14\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Three years had passed away since the escape of the prisoners from\r\n'b'Richmond, and how often during those three years had they spoken of\r\n'b'their country, always present in their thoughts!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They had no doubt that the civil war was at an end, and to them it\r\n'b'appeared impossible that the just cause of the North had not triumphed.\r\n'b'But what had been the incidents of this terrible war? How much blood had\r\n'b'it not cost? How many of their friends must have fallen in the struggle?\r\n'b'They often spoke of these things, without as yet being able to foresee\r\n'b'the day when they would be permitted once more to see their country.\r\n'b'To return thither, were it but for a few days, to renew the social link\r\n'b'with the inhabited world, to establish a communication between their\r\n'b'native land and their island, then to pass the longest, perhaps the\r\n'b'best, portion of their existence in this colony, founded by them,\r\n'b'and which would then be dependent on their country, was this a dream\r\n'b'impossible to realize?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There were only two ways of accomplishing it--either a ship must appear\r\n'b'off Lincoln Island, or the colonists must themselves build a vessel\r\n'b'strong enough to sail to the nearest land.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cUnless,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cour good genius, himself provides us with the\r\n'b'means of returning to our country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And, really, had any one told Pencroft and Neb that a ship of 300 tons\r\n'b'was waiting for them in Shark Gulf or at Port Balloon, they would not\r\n'b'even have made a gesture of surprise. In their state of mind nothing\r\n'b'appeared improbable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But Cyrus Harding, less confident, advised them to confine themselves to\r\n'b'fact, and more especially so with regard to the building of a vessel--a\r\n'b'really urgent work, since it was for the purpose of depositing, as\r\n'b'soon as possible, at Tabor Island a document indicating Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s new\r\n'b'residence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As the \xe2\x80\x9cBonadventure\xe2\x80\x9d no longer existed, six months at least would\r\n'b'be required for the construction of a new vessel. Now winter was\r\n'b'approaching, and the voyage would not be made before the following\r\n'b'spring.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe have time to get everything ready for the fine season,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked\r\n'b'the engineer, who was consulting with Pencroft about these matters. \xe2\x80\x9cI\r\n'b'think, therefore, my friend, that since we have to rebuild our vessel\r\n'b'it will be best to give her larger dimensions. The arrival of the Scotch\r\n'b'yacht at Tabor Island is very uncertain. It may even be that, having\r\n'b'arrived several months ago, she has again sailed after having vainly\r\n'b'searched for some trace of Ayrton. Will it not then be best to build\r\n'b'a ship which, if necessary, could take us either to the Polynesian\r\n'b'Archipelago or to New Zealand? What do you think?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI think, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor; \xe2\x80\x9cI think that you are as\r\n'b'capable of building a large vessel as a small one. Neither the wood nor\r\n'b'the tools are wanting. It is only a question of time.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd how many months would be required to build a vessel of from 250 to\r\n'b'300 tons?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSeven or eight months at least,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cBut it must not be\r\n'b'forgotten that winter is drawing near, and that in severe frost wood is\r\n'b'difficult to work. We must calculate on several weeks delay, and if our\r\n'b'vessel is ready by next November we may think ourselves very lucky.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cthat will be exactly the most favorable\r\n'b'time for undertaking a voyage of any importance, either to Tabor Island\r\n'b'or to a more distant land.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSo it will, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cMake out your plans then;\r\n'b'the workmen are ready, and I imagine that Ayrton can lend us a good\r\n'b'helping hand.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists, having been consulted, approved the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s plan,\r\n'b'and it was, indeed, the best thing to be done. It is true that the\r\n'b'construction of a ship of from two to three hundred tons would be great\r\n'b'labor, but the colonists had confidence in themselves, justified by\r\n'b'their previous success.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding then busied himself in drawing the plan of the vessel and\r\n'b'making the model. During this time his companions employed themselves in\r\n'b'felling and carting trees to furnish the ribs, timbers, and planks.\r\n'b'The forest of the Far West supplied the best oaks and elms. They took\r\n'b'advantage of the opening already made on their last excursion to form a\r\n'b'practicable road, which they named the Far West Road, and the trees were\r\n'b'carried to the Chimneys, where the dockyard was established. As to\r\n'b'the road in question, the choice of trees had rendered its direction\r\n'b'somewhat capricious, but at the same time it facilitated the access to a\r\n'b'large part of the Serpentine Peninsula.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was important that the trees should be quickly felled and cut up, for\r\n'b'they could not be used while yet green, and some time was necessary to\r\n'b'allow them to get seasoned. The carpenters, therefore, worked vigorously\r\n'b'during the month of April, which was troubled only by a few equinoctial\r\n'b'gales of some violence. Master Jup aided them dexterously, either by\r\n'b'climbing to the top of a tree to fasten the ropes or by lending his\r\n'b'stout shoulders to carry the lopped trunks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All this timber was piled up under a large shed, built near the\r\n'b'Chimneys, and there awaited the time for use.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The month of April was tolerably fine, as October often is in the\r\n'b'northern zone. At the same time other work was actively continued, and\r\n'b'soon all trace of devastation disappeared from the plateau of\r\n'b'Prospect Heights. The mill was rebuilt, and new buildings rose in the\r\n'b'poultry-yard. It had appeared necessary to enlarge their dimensions,\r\n'b'for the feathered population had increased considerably. The stable\r\n'b'now contained five onagers, four of which were well broken, and allowed\r\n'b'themselves to be either driven or ridden, and a little colt. The colony\r\n'b'now possessed a plow, to which the onagers were yoked like regular\r\n'b'Yorkshire or Kentucky oxen. The colonists divided their work, and their\r\n'b'arms never tired. Then who could have enjoyed better health than these\r\n'b'workers, and what good humor enlivened the evenings in Granite House as\r\n'b'they formed a thousand plans for the future!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'As a matter of course Ayrton shared the common lot in every respect,\r\n'b'and there was no longer any talk of his going to live at the corral.\r\n'b'Nevertheless he was still sad and reserved, and joined more in the work\r\n'b'than in the pleasures of his companions. But he was a valuable workman\r\n'b'at need--strong, skilful, ingenious, intelligent. He was esteemed and\r\n'b'loved by all, and he could not be ignorant of it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the meanwhile the corral was not abandoned. Every other day one of\r\n'b'the settlers, driving the cart or mounted on an onager, went to look\r\n'b'after the flock of musmons and goats and bring back the supply of\r\n'b'milk required by Neb. These excursions at the same time afforded\r\n'b'opportunities for hunting. Therefore Herbert and Gideon Spilett, with\r\n'b'Top in front, traversed more often than their companions the road to\r\n'b'the corral, and with the capital guns which they carried, capybaras,\r\n'b'agouties, kangaroos, and wild pigs for large game, ducks, grouse,\r\n'b'jacamars, and snipe for small game, were never wanting in the house.\r\n'b'The produce of the warren, of the oyster-bed, several turtles which were\r\n'b'taken, excellent salmon which came up the Mercy, vegetables from the\r\n'b'plateau, wild fruit from the forest, were riches upon riches, and Neb,\r\n'b'the head cook, could scarcely by himself store them away.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The telegraphic wire between the corral and Granite House had of course\r\n'b'been repaired, and it was worked whenever one or other of the settlers\r\n'b'was at the corral and found it necessary to spend the night there.\r\n'b'Besides, the island was safe now and no attacks were to be feared, at\r\n'b'any rate from men.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, that which had happened might happen again. A descent of\r\n'b'pirates, or even of escaped convicts, was always to be feared. It was\r\n'b'possible that companions or accomplices of Bob Harvey had been in the\r\n'b'secret of his plans, and might be tempted to imitate him. The colonists,\r\n'b'therefore, were careful to observe the sea around the island, and every\r\n'b'day their telescope covered the horizon enclosed by Union and Washington\r\n'b'Bays. When they went to the corral they examined the sea to the west\r\n'b'with no less attention, and by climbing the spur their gaze extended\r\n'b'over a large section of the western horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nothing suspicious was discerned, but still it was necessary for them to\r\n'b'be on their guard.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer one evening imparted to his friends a plan which he had\r\n'b'conceived for fortifying the corral. It appeared prudent to him to\r\n'b'heighten the palisade and to flank it with a sort of blockhouse, which,\r\n'b'if necessary, the settlers could hold against the enemy. Granite House\r\n'b'might, by its very position, be considered impregnable; therefore the\r\n'b'corral with its buildings, its stores, and the animals it contained,\r\n'b'would always be the object of pirates, whoever they were, who might land\r\n'b'on the island, and should the colonists be obliged to shut themselves\r\n'b'up there they ought also to be able to defend themselves without any\r\n'b'disadvantage. This was a project which might be left for consideration,\r\n'b'and they were, besides, obliged to put off its execution until the next\r\n'b'spring.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'About the 15th of May the keel of the new vessel lay along the dockyard,\r\n'b'and soon the stem and stern-post, mortised at each of its extremities,\r\n'b'rose almost perpendicularly. The keel, of good oak, measured 110 feet\r\n'b'in length, this allowing a width of five-and-twenty feet to the midship\r\n'b'beam. But this was all the carpenters could do before the arrival of the\r\n'b'frosts and bad weather. During the following week they fixed the first\r\n'b'of the stern timbers, but were then obliged to suspend work.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the last days of the month the weather was extremely bad. The\r\n'b'wind blew from the east, sometimes with the violence of a tempest. The\r\n'b'engineer was somewhat uneasy on account of the dockyard shed--which\r\n'b'besides, he could not have established in any other place near to\r\n'b'Granite House--for the islet only imperfectly sheltered the shore from\r\n'b'the fury of the open sea, and in great storms the waves beat against the\r\n'b'very foot of the granite cliff.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But, very fortunately, these fears were not realized. The wind shifted\r\n'b'to the southeast, and there the beach of Granite House was completely\r\n'b'covered by Flotsam Point.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Ayrton, the most zealous workmen at the new vessel, pursued\r\n'b'their labor as long as they could. They were not men to mind the wind\r\n'b'tearing at their hair, nor the rain wetting them to the skin, and a blow\r\n'b'from a hammer is worth just as much in bad as in fine weather. But when\r\n'b'a severe frost succeeded this wet period, the wood, its fibers acquiring\r\n'b'the hardness of iron, became extremely difficult to work, and about the\r\n'b'10th of June shipbuilding was obliged to be entirely discontinued.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions had not omitted to observe how severe\r\n'b'was the temperature during the winters of Lincoln Island. The cold was\r\n'b'comparable to that experienced in the States of New England, situated at\r\n'b'almost the same distance from the equator. In the northern hemisphere,\r\n'b'or at any rate in the part occupied by British America and the north of\r\n'b'the United States, this phenomenon is explained by the flat conformation\r\n'b'of the territories bordering on the pole, and on which there is no\r\n'b'intumescence of the soil to oppose any obstacle to the north winds;\r\n'b'here, in Lincoln Island, this explanation would not suffice.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt has even been observed,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Harding one day to his companions,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cthat in equal latitudes the islands and coast regions are less tried by\r\n'b'the cold than inland countries. I have often heard it asserted that the\r\n'b'winters of Lombardy, for example, are not less rigorous than those of\r\n'b'Scotland, which results from the sea restoring during the winter the\r\n'b'heat which it received during the summer. Islands are, therefore, in a\r\n'b'better situation for benefiting by this restitution.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut then, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cwhy does Lincoln Island\r\n'b'appear to escape the common law?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is difficult to explain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cHowever, I\r\n'b'should be disposed to conjecture that this peculiarity results from the\r\n'b'situation of the island in the Southern Hemisphere, which, as you know,\r\n'b'my boy, is colder than the Northern Hemisphere.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9cand icebergs are met with in lower latitudes in\r\n'b'the south than in the north of the Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is true,\xe2\x80\x9d remarked Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cand when I have been serving on\r\n'b'board whalers I have seen icebergs off Cape Horn.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe severe cold experienced in Lincoln Island,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cmay then perhaps be explained by the presence of floes or icebergs\r\n'b'comparatively near to Lincoln Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYour opinion is very admissible indeed, my dear Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is evidently to the proximity of icebergs that\r\n'b'we owe our rigorous winters. I would draw your attention also to an\r\n'b'entirely physical cause, which renders the Southern colder than the\r\n'b'Northern Hemisphere. In fact, since the sun is nearer to this hemisphere\r\n'b'during the summer, it is necessarily more distant during the winter.\r\n'b'This explains then the excess of temperature in the two seasons, for, if\r\n'b'we find the winters very cold in Lincoln Island, we must not forget that\r\n'b'the summers here, on the contrary, are very hot.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut why, if you please, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft, knitting his brows,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cwhy should our hemisphere, as you say, be so badly divided? It isn\xe2\x80\x99t\r\n'b'just, that!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFriend Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, laughing, \xe2\x80\x9cwhether just\r\n'b'or not, we must submit to it, and here lies the reason for this\r\n'b'peculiarity. The earth does not describe a circle around the sun, but\r\n'b'an ellipse, as it must by the laws of rational mechanics. Now, the earth\r\n'b'occupies one of the foci of the ellipse, and so at one point in its\r\n'b'course is at its apogee, that is, at its farthest from the sun, and\r\n'b'at another point it is at its perigee, or nearest to the sun. Now it\r\n'b'happens that it is during the winter of the southern countries that\r\n'b'it is at its most distant point from the sun, and consequently, in a\r\n'b'situation for those regions to feel the greatest cold. Nothing can be\r\n'b'done to prevent that, and men, Pencroft, however learned they may be,\r\n'b'can never change anything of the cosmographical order established by God\r\n'b'Himself.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet,\xe2\x80\x9d added Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthe world is very learned. What a big book,\r\n'b'captain, might be made with all that is known!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd what a much bigger book still with all that is not known!\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\n'b'Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last, for one reason or another, the month of June brought the cold\r\n'b'with its accustomed intensity, and the settlers were often confined to\r\n'b'Granite House. Ah! how wearisome this imprisonment was to them, and more\r\n'b'particularly to Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLook here,\xe2\x80\x9d said he to Neb one day, \xe2\x80\x9cI would give you by notarial\r\n'b'deed all the estates which will come to me some day, if you were a good\r\n'b'enough fellow to go, no matter where, and subscribe to some newspaper\r\n'b'for me! Decidedly the thing that is most essential to my happiness is\r\n'b'the knowing every morning what has happened the day before in other\r\n'b'places than this!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb began to laugh.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9c\xe2\x80\x98Pon my word,\xe2\x80\x9d he replied, \xe2\x80\x9cthe only thing I think about is my daily\r\n'b'work!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The truth was that indoors as well as out there was no want of work.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colony of Lincoln Island was now at its highest point of prosperity,\r\n'b'achieved by three years of continued hard work. The destruction of the\r\n'b'brig had been a new source of riches. Without speaking of the complete\r\n'b'rig which would serve for the vessel now on the stocks, utensils and\r\n'b'tools of all sorts, weapons and ammunition, clothes and instruments,\r\n'b'were now piled in the storerooms of Granite House. It had not even\r\n'b'been necessary to resort again to the manufacture of the coarse felt\r\n'b'materials. Though the colonists had suffered from cold during their\r\n'b'first winter, the bad season might now come without their having any\r\n'b'reason to dread its severity. Linen was plentiful also, and besides,\r\n'b'they kept it with extreme care. From chloride of sodium, which is\r\n'b'nothing else than sea salt, Cyrus Harding easily extracted the soda and\r\n'b'chlorine. The soda, which it was easy to change into carbonate of soda,\r\n'b'and the chlorine, of which he made chloride of lime, were employed for\r\n'b'various domestic purposes, and especially in bleaching linen. Besides,\r\n'b'they did not wash more than four times a year, as was done by families\r\n'b'in the olden times, and it may be added, that Pencroft and Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, while waiting for the postman to bring him his newspaper,\r\n'b'distinguished themselves as washermen.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So passed the winter months, June, July, and August. They were severe,\r\n'b'and the average observations of the thermometer did not give more than\r\n'b'eight degrees of Fahrenheit. It was therefore lower in temperature than\r\n'b'the preceding winter. But then, what splendid fires blazed continually\r\n'b'on the hearths of Granite House, the smoke marking the granite wall with\r\n'b'long, zebra-like streaks! Fuel was not spared, as it grew naturally a\r\n'b'few steps from them. Besides, the chips of the wood destined for the\r\n'b'construction of the ship enabled them to economize the coal, which\r\n'b'required more trouble to transport.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Men and animals were all well. Master Jup was a little chilly, it must\r\n'b'be confessed. This was perhaps his only weakness, and it was necessary\r\n'b'to make him a well-padded dressing-gown. But what a servant he was,\r\n'b'clever, zealous, indefatigable, not indiscreet, not talkative, and\r\n'b'he might have been with reason proposed as a model for all his biped\r\n'b'brothers in the Old and New Worlds!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs for that,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwhen one has four hands at one\xe2\x80\x99s service,\r\n'b'of course one\xe2\x80\x99s work ought to be done so much the better!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And indeed the intelligent creature did it well.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the seven months which had passed since the last researches made\r\n'b'round the mountain, and during the month of September, which brought\r\n'b'back fine weather, nothing was heard of the genius of the island. His\r\n'b'power was not manifested in any way. It is true that it would have\r\n'b'been superfluous, for no incident occurred to put the colonists to any\r\n'b'painful trial.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding even observed that if by chance the communication between\r\n'b'the unknown and the tenants of Granite House had ever been established\r\n'b'through the granite, and if Top\xe2\x80\x99s instinct had as it were felt it, there\r\n'b'was no further sign of it during this period. The dog\xe2\x80\x99s growling\r\n'b'had entirely ceased, as well as the uneasiness of the orang. The two\r\n'b'friends--for they were such--no longer prowled round the opening of the\r\n'b'inner well, nor did they bark or whine in that singular way which from\r\n'b'the first the engineer had noticed. But could he be sure that this was\r\n'b'all that was to be said about this enigma, and that he should never\r\n'b'arrive at a solution? Could he be certain that some conjuncture would\r\n'b'not occur which would bring the mysterious personage on the scene? who\r\n'b'could tell what the future might have in reserve?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last the winter was ended, but an event, the consequences of which\r\n'b'might be serious occurred in the first days of the returning spring.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On the 7th of September, Cyrus Harding, having observed the crater, saw\r\n'b'smoke curling round the summit of the mountain, its first vapors rising\r\n'b'in the air.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 15\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists, warned by the engineer, left their work and gazed in\r\n'b'silence at the summit of Mount Franklin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The volcano had awoke, and the vapor had penetrated the mineral layer\r\n'b'heaped at the bottom of the crater. But would the subterranean fires\r\n'b'provoke any violent eruption? This was an event which could not be\r\n'b'foreseen. However, even while admitting the possibility of an eruption,\r\n'b'it was not probable that the whole of Lincoln Island would suffer from\r\n'b'it. The flow of volcanic matter is not always disastrous, and the island\r\n'b'had already undergone this trial, as was shown by the streams of lava\r\n'b'hardened on the northern slopes of the mountain. Besides, from the shape\r\n'b'of the crater--the opening broken in the upper edge--the matter would be\r\n'b'thrown to the side opposite the fertile regions of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, the past did not necessarily answer for the future. Often, at\r\n'b'the summit of volcanoes, the old craters close and new ones open.\r\n'b'This had occurred in the two hemispheres--at Etna, Popocatepetl, at\r\n'b'Orizabaand on the eve of an eruption there is everything to be feared.\r\n'b'In fact, an earthquake--a phenomenon which often accompanies volcanic\r\n'b'eruption--is enough to change the interior arrangement of a mountain,\r\n'b'and to open new outlets for the burning lava.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding explained these things to his companions, and, without\r\n'b'exaggerating the state of things, he told them all the pros and cons.\r\n'b'After all, they could not prevent it. It did not appear likely that\r\n'b'Granite House would be threatened unless the ground was shaken by an\r\n'b'earthquake. But the corral would be in great danger should a new crater\r\n'b'open in the southern side of Mount Franklin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From that day the smoke never disappeared from the top of the mountain,\r\n'b'and it could even be perceived that it increased in height and\r\n'b'thickness, without any flame mingling in its heavy volumes. The\r\n'b'phenomenon was still concentrated in the lower part of the central\r\n'b'crater.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'However, with the fine days work had been continued. The building of the\r\n'b'vessel was hastened as much as possible, and, by means of the waterfall\r\n'b'on the shore, Cyrus Harding managed to establish an hydraulic sawmill,\r\n'b'which rapidly cut up the trunks of trees into planks and joists. The\r\n'b'mechanism of this apparatus was as simple as those used in the rustic\r\n'b'sawmills of Norway. A first horizontal movement to move the piece of\r\n'b'wood, a second vertical movement to move the saw--this was all that was\r\n'b'wanted; and the engineer succeeded by means of a wheel, two cylinders,\r\n'b'and pulleys properly arranged. Towards the end of the month of September\r\n'b'the skeleton of the vessel, which was to be rigged as a schooner, lay\r\n'b'in the dockyard. The ribs were almost entirely completed, and, all the\r\n'b'timbers having been sustained by a provisional band, the shape of the\r\n'b'vessel could already be seen. The schooner, sharp in the bows, very\r\n'b'slender in the after-part, would evidently be suitable for a long\r\n'b'voyage, if wanted; but laying the planking would still take a\r\n'b'considerable time. Very fortunately, the iron work of the pirate brig\r\n'b'had been saved after the explosion. From the planks and injured ribs\r\n'b'Pencroft and Ayrton had extracted the bolts and a large quantity\r\n'b'of copper nails. It was so much work saved for the smiths, but the\r\n'b'carpenters had much to do.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Shipbuilding was interrupted for a week for the harvest, the haymaking,\r\n'b'and the gathering in of the different crops on the plateau. This work\r\n'b'finished, every moment was devoted to finishing the schooner. When night\r\n'b'came the workmen were really quite exhausted. So as not to lose any\r\n'b'time they had changed the hours for their meals; they dined at twelve\r\n'b'o\xe2\x80\x99clock, and only had their supper when daylight failed them. They then\r\n'b'ascended to Granite House, when they were always ready to go to bed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Sometimes, however, when the conversation bore on some interesting\r\n'b'subject the hour for sleep was delayed for a time. The colonists then\r\n'b'spoke of the future, and talked willingly of the changes which a voyage\r\n'b'in the schooner to inhabited lands would make in their situation.\r\n'b'But always, in the midst of these plans, prevailed the thought of a\r\n'b'subsequent return to Lincoln Island. Never would they abandon this\r\n'b'colony, founded with so much labor and with such success, and to which\r\n'b'a communication with America would afford a fresh impetus. Pencroft and\r\n'b'Neb especially hoped to end their days there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHerbert,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will never abandon Lincoln Island?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNever, Pencroft, and especially if you make up your mind to stay\r\n'b'there.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat was made up long ago, my boy,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall expect\r\n'b'you. You will bring me your wife and children, and I shall make jolly\r\n'b'chaps of your youngsters!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat\xe2\x80\x99s agreed,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, laughing and blushing at the same\r\n'b'time.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd you, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed Pencroft enthusiastically, \xe2\x80\x9cyou will\r\n'b'be still the governor of the island! Ah, how many inhabitants could it\r\n'b'support? Ten thousand at least!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They talked in this way, allowing Pencroft to run on, and at last the\r\n'b'reporter actually started a newspaper--the New Lincoln Herald!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'So is man\xe2\x80\x99s heart. The desire to perform a work which will endure, which\r\n'b'will survive him, is the origin of his superiority over all other living\r\n'b'creatures here below. It is this which has established his dominion, and\r\n'b'this it is which justifies it, over all the world.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After that, who knows if Jup and Top had not themselves their little\r\n'b'dream of the future.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton silently said to himself that he would like to see Lord Glenarvan\r\n'b'again and show himself to all restored.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'One evening, on the 15th of October, the conversation was prolonged\r\n'b'later than usual. It was nine o\xe2\x80\x99clock. Already, long badly concealed\r\n'b'yawns gave warning of the hour of rest, and Pencroft was proceeding\r\n'b'towards his bed, when the electric bell, placed in the dining-room,\r\n'b'suddenly rang.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All were there, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Ayrton,\r\n'b'Pencroft, Neb. Therefore none of the colonists were at the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding rose. His companions stared at each other, scarcely\r\n'b'believing their ears.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat does that mean?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb. \xe2\x80\x9cWas it the devil who rang it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No one answered.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe weather is stormy,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Herbert. \xe2\x80\x9cMight not its influence of\r\n'b'electricity--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert did not finish his phrase. The engineer, towards whom all eyes\r\n'b'were turned, shook his head negatively.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett. \xe2\x80\x9cIf it is a signal, whoever it may\r\n'b'be who has made it, he will renew it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut who do you think it is?\xe2\x80\x9d cried Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho?\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cbut he--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sailor\xe2\x80\x99s sentence was cut short by a new tinkle of the bell.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding went to the apparatus, and sent this question to the corral:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat do you want?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few moments later the needle, moving on the alphabetic dial, gave this\r\n'b'reply to the tenants of Granite House:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome to the corral immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt last!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Yes! At last! The mystery was about to be unveiled. The colonists\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'fatigue had disappeared before the tremendous interest which was about\r\n'b'to urge them to the corral, and all wish for rest had ceased. Without\r\n'b'having uttered a word, in a few moments they had left Granite House,\r\n'b'and were standing on the beach. Jup and Top alone were left behind. They\r\n'b'could do without them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The night was black. The new moon had disappeared at the same time as\r\n'b'the sun. As Herbert had observed, great stormy clouds formed a lowering\r\n'b'and heavy vault, preventing any star rays. A few lightning flashes,\r\n'b'reflections from a distant storm, illuminated the horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was possible that a few hours later the thunder would roll over the\r\n'b'island itself. The night was very threatening.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But however deep the darkness was, it would not prevent them from\r\n'b'finding the familiar road to the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They ascended the left bank of the Mercy, reached the plateau, passed\r\n'b'the bridge over Creek Glycerine, and advanced through the forest.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They walked at a good pace, a prey to the liveliest emotions. There was\r\n'b'no doubt but that they were now going to learn the long-searched-for\r\n'b'answer to the enigma, the name of that mysterious being, so deeply\r\n'b'concerned in their life, so generous in his influence, so powerful\r\n'b'in his action! Must not this stranger have indeed mingled with their\r\n'b'existence, have known the smallest details, have heard all that was said\r\n'b'in Granite House, to have been able always to act in the very nick of\r\n'b'time?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Every one, wrapped up in his own reflections, pressed forward. Under the\r\n'b'arch of trees the darkness was such that even the edge of the road\r\n'b'could not be seen. Not a sound in the forest. Both animals and birds,\r\n'b'influenced by the heaviness of the atmosphere, remained motionless\r\n'b'and silent. Not a breath disturbed the leaves. The footsteps of the\r\n'b'colonists alone resounded on the hardened ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the first quarter of an hour the silence was only interrupted by\r\n'b'this remark from Pencroft:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe ought to have brought a torch.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And by this reply from the engineer:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall find one at the corral.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding and his companions had left Granite House at twelve minutes past\r\n'b'nine. At forty-seven minutes past nine they had traversed three out of\r\n'b'the five miles which separated the mouth of the Mercy from the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At that moment sheets of lightning spread over the island and illumined\r\n'b'the dark trees. The flashes dazzled and almost blinded them. Evidently\r\n'b'the storm would not be long in bursting forth.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The flashes gradually became brighter and more rapid. Distant thunder\r\n'b'growled in the sky. The atmosphere was stifling.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists proceeded as if they were urged onwards by some\r\n'b'irresistible force.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock a vivid flash showed them the palisade, and as they\r\n'b'reached the gate the storm burst forth with tremendous fury.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a minute the corral was crossed, and Harding stood before the hut.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Probably the house was occupied by the stranger, since it was from\r\n'b'thence that the telegram had been sent. However, no light shone through\r\n'b'the window.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer knocked at the door.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No answer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding opened the door, and the settlers entered the room, which\r\n'b'was perfectly dark. A light was struck by Neb, and in a few moments the\r\n'b'lantern was lighted and the light thrown into every corner of the room.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no one there. Everything was in the state in which it had been\r\n'b'left.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHave we been deceived by an illusion?\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No! that was not possible! The telegram had clearly said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCome to the corral immediately.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They approached the table specially devoted to the use of the wire.\r\n'b'Everything was in order--the pile on the box containing it, as well as\r\n'b'all the apparatus.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho came here the last time?\xe2\x80\x9d asked the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI did, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd that was--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFour days ago.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh! a note!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Herbert, pointing to a paper lying on the table.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this paper were written these words in English:--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFollow the new wire.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Harding, who understood that the despatch had not been\r\n'b'sent from the corral, but from the mysterious retreat, communicating\r\n'b'directly with Granite House by means of a supplementary wire joined to\r\n'b'the old one.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neb took the lighted lantern, and all left the corral. The storm\r\n'b'then burst forth with tremendous violence. The interval between each\r\n'b'lightning-flash and each thunder-clap diminished rapidly. The summit\r\n'b'of the volcano, with its plume of vapor, could be seen by occasional\r\n'b'flashes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was no telegraphic communication in any part of the corral between\r\n'b'the house and the palisade; but the engineer, running straight to the\r\n'b'first post, saw by the light of a flash a new wire hanging from the\r\n'b'isolator to the ground.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThere it is!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This wire lay along the ground, and was surrounded with an isolating\r\n'b'substance like a submarine cable, so as to assure the free transmission\r\n'b'of the current. It appeared to pass through the wood and the southern\r\n'b'spurs of the mountain, and consequently it ran towards the west.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFollow it!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the settlers immediately pressed forward, guided by the wire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The thunder continued to roar with such violence that not a word could\r\n'b'be heard. However, there was no occasion for speaking, but to get\r\n'b'forward as fast as possible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions then climbed the spur rising between\r\n'b'the corral valley and that of Falls River, which they crossed at its\r\n'b'narrowest part. The wire, sometimes stretched over the lower branches\r\n'b'of the trees, sometimes lying on the ground, guided them surely. The\r\n'b'engineer had supposed that the wire would perhaps stop at the bottom of\r\n'b'the valley, and that the stranger\xe2\x80\x99s retreat would be there.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nothing of the sort. They were obliged to ascend the south-western spur,\r\n'b'and re-descend on that arid plateau terminated by the strangely-wild\r\n'b'basalt cliff. From time to time one of the colonists stooped down and\r\n'b'felt for the wire with his hands; but there was now no doubt that the\r\n'b'wire was running directly towards the sea. There, to a certainty, in the\r\n'b'depths of those rocks, was the dwelling so long sought for in vain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sky was literally on fire. Flash succeeded flash. Several struck the\r\n'b'summit of the volcano in the midst of the thick smoke. It appeared there\r\n'b'as if the mountain was vomiting flame. At a few minutes to eleven the\r\n'b'colonists arrived on the high cliff overlooking the ocean to the west.\r\n'b'The wind had risen. The surf roared 500 feet below.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding calculated that they had gone a mile and a half from the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this point the wire entered among the rocks, following the steep side\r\n'b'of a narrow ravine. The settlers followed it at the risk of occasioning\r\n'b'a fall of the slightly-balanced rocks, and being dashed into the sea.\r\n'b'The descent was extremely perilous, but they did not think of the\r\n'b'danger; they were no longer masters of themselves, and an irresistible\r\n'b'attraction drew them towards this mysterious place as the magnet draws\r\n'b'iron.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus they almost unconsciously descended this ravine, which even in\r\n'b'broad daylight would have been considered impracticable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stones rolled and sparkled like fiery balls when they crossed\r\n'b'through the gleams of light. Harding was first--Ayrton last. On they\r\n'b'went, step by step. Now they slid over the slippery rock; then they\r\n'b'struggled to their feet and scrambled on.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At last the wire touched the rocks on the beach. The colonists had\r\n'b'reached the bottom of the basalt cliff.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There appeared a narrow ridge, running horizontally and parallel with\r\n'b'the sea. The settlers followed the wire along it. They had not gone a\r\n'b'hundred paces when the ridge by a moderate incline sloped down to the\r\n'b'level of the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer seized the wire and found that it disappeared beneath the\r\n'b'waves.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His companions were stupefied.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A cry of disappointment, almost a cry of despair, escaped them! Must\r\n'b'they then plunge beneath the water and seek there for some submarine\r\n'b'cavern? In their excited state they would not have hesitated to do it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer stopped them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He led his companions to a hollow in the rocks, and there--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe must wait,\xe2\x80\x9d said he. \xe2\x80\x9cThe tide is high. At low water the way will be\r\n'b'open.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what can make you think-\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe would not have called us if the means had been wanting to enable us\r\n'b'to reach him!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding spoke in a tone of such thorough conviction that no\r\n'b'objection was raised. His remark, besides, was logical. It was quite\r\n'b'possible that an opening, practicable at low water, though hidden now by\r\n'b'the high tide, opened at the foot of the cliff.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There was some time to wait. The colonists remained silently crouching\r\n'b'in a deep hollow. Rain now began to fall in torrents. The thunder was\r\n'b're-echoed among the rocks with a grand sonorousness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists\xe2\x80\x99 emotion was great. A thousand strange and extraordinary\r\n'b'ideas crossed their brains, and they expected some grand and superhuman\r\n'b'apparition, which alone could come up to the notion they had formed of\r\n'b'the mysterious genius of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At midnight, Harding carrying the lantern, descended to the beach to\r\n'b'reconnoiter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer was not mistaken. The beginning of an immense excavation\r\n'b'could be seen under the water. There the wire, bending at a right angle,\r\n'b'entered the yawning gulf.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding returned to his companions, and said simply,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn an hour the opening will be practicable.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is there, then?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDid you doubt it?\xe2\x80\x9d returned Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut this cavern must be filled with water to a certain height,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' observed Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEither the cavern will be completely dry,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand in\r\n'b'that case we can traverse it on foot, or it will not be dry, and some\r\n'b'means of transport will be put at our disposal.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An hour passed. All climbed down through the rain to the level of the\r\n'b'sea. There was now eight feet of the opening above the water. It was\r\n'b'like the arch of a bridge, under which rushed the foaming water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Leaning forward, the engineer saw a black object floating on the\r\n'b'water. He drew it towards him. It was a boat, moored to some interior\r\n'b'projection of the cave. This boat was iron-plated. Two oars lay at the\r\n'b'bottom.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cJump in!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In a moment the settlers were in the boat. Neb and Ayrton took the\r\n'b'oars, Pencroft the rudder. Cyrus Harding in the bows, with the lantern,\r\n'b'lighted the way.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The elliptical roof, under which the boat at first passed, suddenly\r\n'b'rose; but the darkness was too deep, and the light of the lantern too\r\n'b'slight, for either the extent, length, height, or depth of the cave to\r\n'b'be ascertained. Solemn silence reigned in this basaltic cavern. Not a\r\n'b'sound could penetrate into it, even the thunder peals could not pierce\r\n'b'its thick sides.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Such immense caves exist in various parts of the world, natural crypts\r\n'b'dating from the geological epoch of the globe. Some are filled by the\r\n'b'sea; others contain entire lakes in their sides. Such is Fingal\xe2\x80\x99s Cave,\r\n'b'in the island of Staffa, one of the Hebrides; such are the caves of\r\n'b'Morgat, in the bay of Douarnenez, in Brittany, the caves of Bonifacio,\r\n'b'in Corsica, those of Lyse-Fjord, in Norway; such are the immense Mammoth\r\n'b'caverns in Kentucky, 500 feet in height, and more than twenty miles in\r\n'b'length! In many parts of the globe, nature has excavated these caverns,\r\n'b'and preserved them for the admiration of man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Did the cavern which the settlers were now exploring extend to the\r\n'b'center of the island? For a quarter of an hour the boat had been\r\n'b'advancing, making detours, indicated to Pencroft by the engineer in\r\n'b'short sentences, when all at once,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMore to the right!\xe2\x80\x9d he commanded.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The boat, altering its course, came up alongside the right wall. The\r\n'b'engineer wished to see if the wire still ran along the side.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The wire was there fastened to the rock.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the two oars, plunging into the dark waters, urged the boat onwards.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On they went for another quarter of an hour, and a distance of\r\n'b'half-a-mile must have been cleared from the mouth of the cave, when\r\n'b'Harding\xe2\x80\x99s voice was again heard.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cStop!\xe2\x80\x9d said he.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The boat stopped, and the colonists perceived a bright light\r\n'b'illuminating the vast cavern, so deeply excavated in the bowels of the\r\n'b'island, of which nothing had ever led them to suspect the existence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At a height of a hundred feet rose the vaulted roof, supported on basalt\r\n'b'shafts. Irregular arches, strange moldings, appeared on the columns\r\n'b'erected by nature in thousands from the first epochs of the formation of\r\n'b'the globe. The basalt pillars, fitted one into the other, measured\r\n'b'from forty to fifty feet in height, and the water, calm in spite of the\r\n'b'tumult outside, washed their base. The brilliant focus of light, pointed\r\n'b'out by the engineer, touched every point of rocks, and flooded the walls\r\n'b'with light.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'By reflection the water reproduced the brilliant sparkles, so that the\r\n'b'boat appeared to be floating between two glittering zones. They could\r\n'b'not be mistaken in the nature of the irradiation thrown from the glowing\r\n'b'nucleus, whose clear rays were shattered by all the angles, all the\r\n'b'projections of the cavern. This light proceeded from an electric source,\r\n'b'and its white color betrayed its origin. It was the sun of this cave,\r\n'b'and it filled it entirely.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At a sign from Cyrus Harding the oars again plunged into the water,\r\n'b'causing a regular shower of gems, and the boat was urged forward towards\r\n'b'the light, which was now not more than half a cable\xe2\x80\x99s length distant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this place the breadth of the sheet of water measured nearly 350\r\n'b'feet, and beyond the dazzling center could be seen an enormous basaltic\r\n'b'wall, blocking up any issue on that side. The cavern widened here\r\n'b'considerably, the sea forming a little lake. But the roof, the side\r\n'b'walls, the end cliff, all the prisms, all the peaks, were flooded with\r\n'b'the electric fluid, so that the brilliancy belonged to them, and as if\r\n'b'the light issued from them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the center of the lake a long cigar-shaped object floated on the\r\n'b'surface of the water, silent, motionless. The brilliancy which issued\r\n'b'from it escaped from its sides as from two kilns heated to a white heat.\r\n'b'This apparatus, similar in shape to an enormous whale, was about 250\r\n'b'feet long, and rose about ten or twelve above the water.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The boat slowly approached it, Cyrus Harding stood up in the bows. He\r\n'b'gazed, a prey to violent excitement. Then, all at once, seizing the\r\n'b'reporter\xe2\x80\x99s arm,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is he! It can only be he!\xe2\x80\x9d he cried, \xe2\x80\x9che!--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, falling back on the seat, he murmured a name which Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'alone could hear.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The reporter evidently knew this name, for it had a wonderful effect\r\n'b'upon him, and he answered in a hoarse voice,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe! an outlawed man!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe!\xe2\x80\x9d said Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s command the boat approached this singular floating\r\n'b'apparatus. The boat touched the left side, from which escaped a ray of\r\n'b'light through a thick glass.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Harding and his companions mounted on the platform. An open hatchway was\r\n'b'there. All darted down the opening.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At the bottom of the ladder was a deck, lighted by electricity. At the\r\n'b'end of this deck was a door, which Harding opened.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A richly-ornamented room, quickly traversed by the colonists, was joined\r\n'b'to a library, over which a luminous ceiling shed a flood of light.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At the end of the library a large door, also shut, was opened by the\r\n'b'engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An immense saloon--a sort of museum, in which were heaped up, with\r\n'b'all the treasures of the mineral world, works of art, marvels of\r\n'b'industry--appeared before the eyes of the colonists, who almost thought\r\n'b'themselves suddenly transported into a land of enchantment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Stretched on a rich sofa they saw a man, who did not appear to notice\r\n'b'their presence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then Harding raised his voice, and to the extreme surprise of his\r\n'b'companions, he uttered these words,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Nemo, you asked for us! We are here.--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 16\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At these words the reclining figure rose, and the electric light fell\r\n'b'upon his countenance; a magnificent head, the forehead high, the glance\r\n'b'commanding, beard white, hair abundant and falling over the shoulders.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His hand rested upon the cushion of the divan from which he had just\r\n'b'risen. He appeared perfectly calm. It was evident that his strength had\r\n'b'been gradually undermined by illness, but his voice seemed yet powerful,\r\n'b'as he said in English, and in a tone which evinced extreme surprise,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cSir, I have no name.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless, I know you!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Nemo fixed his penetrating gaze upon the engineer, as though he\r\n'b'were about to annihilate him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then, falling back amid the pillows of the divan,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAfter all, what matters now?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured; \xe2\x80\x9cI am dying!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding drew near the captain, and Gideon Spilett took his\r\n'b'hand--it was of a feverish heat. Ayrton, Pencroft, Herbert, and Neb\r\n'b'stood respectfully apart in an angle of the magnificent saloon, whose\r\n'b'atmosphere was saturated with the electric fluid.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile Captain Nemo withdrew his hand, and motioned the engineer and\r\n'b'the reporter to be seated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All regarded him with profound emotion. Before them they beheld that\r\n'b'being whom they had styled the \xe2\x80\x9cgenius of the island,\xe2\x80\x9d the powerful\r\n'b'protector whose intervention, in so many circumstances, had been so\r\n'b'efficacious, the benefactor to whom they owed such a debt of gratitude!\r\n'b'Their eyes beheld a man only, and a man at the point of death, where\r\n'b'Pencroft and Neb had expected to find an almost supernatural being!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But how happened it that Cyrus Harding had recognized Captain Nemo? why\r\n'b'had the latter so suddenly risen on hearing this name uttered, a name\r\n'b'which he had believed known to none?--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The captain had resumed his position on the divan, and leaning on his\r\n'b'arm, he regarded the engineer, seated near him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou know the name I formerly bore, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d he asked.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand also that of this wonderful\r\n'b'submarine vessel--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus\xe2\x80\x99?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, with a faint smile.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus.\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut do you--do you know who I am?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is nevertheless many years since I have held any communication with\r\n'b'the inhabited world; three long years have I passed in the depth of\r\n'b'the sea, the only place where I have found liberty! Who then can have\r\n'b'betrayed my secret?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA man who was bound to you by no tie, Captain Nemo, and who,\r\n'b'consequently, cannot be accused of treachery.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe Frenchman who was cast on board my vessel by chance sixteen years\r\n'b'since?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe same.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHe and his two companions did not then perish in the maelstrom, in the\r\n'b'midst of which the \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus\xe2\x80\x99 was struggling?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey escaped, and a book has appeared under the title of \xe2\x80\x98Twenty\r\n'b'Thousand Leagues Under the Sea,\xe2\x80\x99 which contains your history.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe history of a few months only of my life!\xe2\x80\x9d interrupted the captain\r\n'b'impetuously.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is true,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cbut a few months of that strange\r\n'b'life have sufficed to make you known.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs a great criminal, doubtless!\xe2\x80\x9d said Captain Nemo, a haughty smile\r\n'b'curling his lips. \xe2\x80\x9cYes, a rebel, perhaps an outlaw against humanity!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer was silent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, sir?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is not for me to judge you, Captain Nemo,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cat any rate as regards your past life. I am, with the rest of the\r\n'b'world, ignorant of the motives which induced you to adopt this strange\r\n'b'mode of existence, and I cannot judge of effects without knowing their\r\n'b'causes; but what I do know is, that a beneficent hand has constantly\r\n'b'protected us since our arrival on Lincoln Island, that we all owe our\r\n'b'lives to a good, generous, and powerful being, and that this being so\r\n'b'powerful, good and generous, Captain Nemo, is yourself!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is I,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the captain simply.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer and the reporter rose. Their companions had drawn near, and\r\n'b'the gratitude with which their hearts were charged was about to express\r\n'b'itself in their gestures and words.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Nemo stopped them by a sign, and in a voice which betrayed more\r\n'b'emotion than he doubtless intended to show.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWait till you have heard all,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And the captain, in a few concise sentences, ran over the events of his\r\n'b'life.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His narrative was short, yet he was obliged to summon up his whole\r\n'b'remaining energy to arrive at the end. He was evidently contending\r\n'b'against extreme weakness. Several times Cyrus Harding entreated him to\r\n'b'repose for a while, but he shook his head as a man to whom the morrow\r\n'b'may never come, and when the reporter offered his assistance,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is useless,\xe2\x80\x9d he said; \xe2\x80\x9cmy hours are numbered.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Nemo was an Indian, the Prince Dakkar, son of a rajah of the\r\n'b'then independent territory of Bundelkund. His father sent him, when ten\r\n'b'years of age, to Europe, in order that he might receive an education\r\n'b'in all respects complete, and in the hopes that by his talents and\r\n'b'knowledge he might one day take a leading part in raising his long\r\n'b'degraded and heathen country to a level with the nations of Europe.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'From the age of ten years to that of thirty Prince Dakkar, endowed by\r\n'b'Nature with her richest gifts of intellect, accumulated knowledge of\r\n'b'every kind, and in science, literature, and art his researches were\r\n'b'extensive and profound.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He traveled over the whole of Europe. His rank and fortune caused him to\r\n'b'be everywhere sought after; but the pleasures of the world had for him\r\n'b'no attractions. Though young and possessed of every personal advantage,\r\n'b'he was ever grave--somber even--devoured by an unquenchable thirst for\r\n'b'knowledge, and cherishing in the recesses of his heart the hope that\r\n'b'he might become a great and powerful ruler of a free and enlightened\r\n'b'people.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Still, for long the love of science triumphed over all other feelings.\r\n'b'He became an artist deeply impressed by the marvels of art, a\r\n'b'philosopher to whom no one of the higher sciences was unknown, a\r\n'b'statesman versed in the policy of European courts. To the eyes of those\r\n'b'who observed him superficially he might have passed for one of those\r\n'b'cosmopolitans, curious of knowledge, but disdaining action; one of those\r\n'b'opulent travelers, haughty and cynical, who move incessantly from place\r\n'b'to place, and are of no country.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The history of Captain Nemo has, in fact, been published under the title\r\n'b'of \xe2\x80\x9cTwenty Thousand Leagues Under the Sea.\xe2\x80\x9d Here, therefore, will apply\r\n'b'the observation already made as to the adventures of Ayrton with regard\r\n'b'to the discrepancy of dates. Readers should therefore refer to the note\r\n'b'already published on this point.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This artist, this philosopher, this man was, however, still cherishing\r\n'b'the hope instilled into him from his earliest days.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Prince Dakkar returned to Bundelkund in the year 1849. He married a\r\n'b'noble Indian lady, who was imbued with an ambition not less ardent than\r\n'b'that by which he was inspired. Two children were born to them, whom they\r\n'b'tenderly loved. But domestic happiness did not prevent him from seeking\r\n'b'to carry out the object at which he aimed. He waited an opportunity. At\r\n'b'length, as he vainly fancied, it presented itself.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Instigated by princes equally ambitious and less sagacious and more\r\n'b'unscrupulous than he was, the people of India were persuaded that they\r\n'b'might successfully rise against their English rulers, who had brought\r\n'b'them out of a state of anarchy and constant warfare and misery, and had\r\n'b'established peace and prosperity in their country. Their ignorance and\r\n'b'gross superstition made them the facile tools of their designing chiefs.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In 1857 the great sepoy revolt broke out. Prince Dakkar, under the\r\n'b'belief that he should thereby have the opportunity of attaining the\r\n'b'object of his long-cherished ambition, was easily drawn into it. He\r\n'b'forthwith devoted his talents and wealth to the service of this cause.\r\n'b'He aided it in person; he fought in the front ranks; he risked his life\r\n'b'equally with the humblest of the wretched and misguided fanatics; he was\r\n'b'ten times wounded in twenty engagements, seeking death but finding it\r\n'b'not, but at length the sanguinary rebels were utterly defeated, and the\r\n'b'atrocious mutiny was brought to an end.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Never before had the British power in India been exposed to such danger,\r\n'b'and if, as they had hoped, the sepoys had received assistance from\r\n'b'without, the influence and supremacy in Asia of the United Kingdom would\r\n'b'have been a thing of the past.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The name of Prince Dakkar was at that time well known. He had fought\r\n'b'openly and without concealment. A price was set upon his head, but he\r\n'b'managed to escape from his pursuers.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Civilization never recedes; the law of necessity ever forces it onwards.\r\n'b'The sepoys were vanquished, and the land of the rajahs of old fell again\r\n'b'under the rule of England.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Prince Dakkar, unable to find that death he courted, returned to the\r\n'b'mountain fastnesses of Bundelkund. There, alone in the world, overcome\r\n'b'by disappointment at the destruction of all his vain hopes, a prey\r\n'b'to profound disgust for all human beings, filled with hatred of the\r\n'b'civilized world, he realized the wreck of his fortune, assembled some\r\n'b'score of his most faithful companions, and one day disappeared, leaving\r\n'b'no trace behind.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Where, then, did he seek that liberty denied him upon the inhabited\r\n'b'earth? Under the waves, in the depths of the ocean, where none could\r\n'b'follow.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The warrior became the man of science. Upon a deserted island of the\r\n'b'Pacific he established his dockyard, and there a submarine vessel was\r\n'b'constructed from his designs. By methods which will at some future\r\n'b'day be revealed he had rendered subservient the illimitable forces of\r\n'b'electricity, which, extracted from inexhaustible sources, was employed\r\n'b'for all the requirements of his floating equipage, as a moving,\r\n'b'lighting, and heating agent. The sea, with its countless treasures, its\r\n'b'myriads of fish, its numberless wrecks, its enormous mammalia, and not\r\n'b'only all that nature supplied, but also all that man had lost in its\r\n'b'depths, sufficed for every want of the prince and his crew--and thus was\r\n'b'his most ardent desire accomplished, never again to hold communication\r\n'b'with the earth. He named his submarine vessel the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus,\xe2\x80\x9d called\r\n'b'himself simply Captain Nemo, and disappeared beneath the seas.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During many years this strange being visited every ocean, from pole to\r\n'b'pole. Outcast of the inhabited earth in these unknown worlds he gathered\r\n'b'incalculable treasures. The millions lost in the Bay of Vigo, in 1702,\r\n'b'by the galleons of Spain, furnished him with a mine of inexhaustible\r\n'b'riches which he devoted always, anonymously, in favor of those nations\r\n'b'who fought for the independence of their country.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'  (This refers to the resurrection of the Candiotes, who were, in\r\n'b'   fact, largely assisted by Captain Nemo.)\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For long, however, he had held no communication with his\r\n'b'fellow-creatures, when, during the night of the 6th of November, 1866,\r\n'b'three men were cast on board his vessel. They were a French professor,\r\n'b'his servant, and a Canadian fisherman. These three men had been hurled\r\n'b'overboard by a collision which had taken place between the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' and the United States frigate \xe2\x80\x9cAbraham Lincoln,\xe2\x80\x9d which had chased her.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Nemo learned from this professor that the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus,\xe2\x80\x9d taken now\r\n'b'for a gigantic mammal of the whale species, now for a submarine vessel\r\n'b'carrying a crew of pirates, was sought for in every sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He might have returned these three men to the ocean, from whence chance\r\n'b'had brought them in contact with his mysterious existence. Instead of\r\n'b'doing this he kept them prisoners, and during seven months they were\r\n'b'enabled to behold all the wonders of a voyage of twenty thousand leagues\r\n'b'under the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'One day, the 22nd of June, 1867, these three men, who knew nothing of\r\n'b'the past history of Captain Nemo, succeeded in escaping in one of the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x99s\xe2\x80\x9d boats. But as at this time the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d was drawn into\r\n'b'the vortex of the maelstrom, off the coast of Norway, the captain\r\n'b'naturally believed that the fugitives, engulfed in that frightful\r\n'b'whirlpool, found their death at the bottom of the abyss. He was unaware\r\n'b'that the Frenchman and his two companions had been miraculously cast\r\n'b'on shore, that the fishermen of the Lofoten Islands had rendered\r\n'b'them assistance, and that the professor, on his return to France, had\r\n'b'published that work in which seven months of the strange and eventful\r\n'b'navigation of the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d were narrated and exposed to the curiosity\r\n'b'of the public.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'For a long time after this, Captain Nemo continued to live thus,\r\n'b'traversing every sea. But one by one his companions died, and found\r\n'b'their last resting-place in their cemetery of coral, in the bed of the\r\n'b'Pacific. At last Captain Nemo remained the solitary survivor of all\r\n'b'those who had taken refuge with him in the depths of the ocean.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He was now sixty years of age. Although alone, he succeeded in\r\n'b'navigating the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d towards one of those submarine caverns which\r\n'b'had sometimes served him as a harbor.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'One of these ports was hollowed beneath Lincoln Island, and at this\r\n'b'moment furnished an asylum to the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The captain had now remained there six years, navigating the ocean no\r\n'b'longer, but awaiting death, and that moment when he should rejoin his\r\n'b'former companions, when by chance he observed the descent of the balloon\r\n'b'which carried the prisoners of the Confederates. Clad in his diving\r\n'b'dress he was walking beneath the water at a few cables\xe2\x80\x99 length from the\r\n'b'shore of the island, when the engineer had been thrown into the sea.\r\n'b'Moved by a feeling of compassion the captain saved Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His first impulse was to fly from the vicinity of the five castaways;\r\n'b'but his harbor refuge was closed, for in consequence of an elevation of\r\n'b'the basalt, produced by the influence of volcanic action, he could\r\n'b'no longer pass through the entrance of the vault. Though there was\r\n'b'sufficient depth of water to allow a light craft to pass the bar,\r\n'b'there was not enough for the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus,\xe2\x80\x9d whose draught of water was\r\n'b'considerable.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Nemo was compelled, therefore, to remain. He observed these men\r\n'b'thrown without resources upon a desert island, but had no wish to be\r\n'b'himself discovered by them. By degrees he became interested in their\r\n'b'efforts when he saw them honest, energetic, and bound to each other by\r\n'b'the ties of friendship. As if despite his wishes, he penetrated all the\r\n'b'secrets of their existence. By means of the diving dress he could easily\r\n'b'reach the well in the interior of Granite House, and climbing by the\r\n'b'projections of rock to its upper orifice he heard the colonists as they\r\n'b'recounted the past, and studied the present and future. He learned from\r\n'b'them the tremendous conflict of America with America itself, for the\r\n'b'abolition of slavery. Yes, these men were worthy to reconcile Captain\r\n'b'Nemo with that humanity which they represented so nobly in the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Nemo had saved Cyrus Harding. It was he also who had brought\r\n'b'back the dog to the Chimneys, who rescued Top from the waters of the\r\n'b'lake, who caused to fall at Flotsam Point the case containing so many\r\n'b'things useful to the colonists, who conveyed the canoe back into the\r\n'b'stream of the Mercy, who cast the cord from the top of Granite House at\r\n'b'the time of the attack by the baboons, who made known the presence\r\n'b'of Ayrton upon Tabor Island, by means of the document enclosed in the\r\n'b'bottle, who caused the explosion of the brig by the shock of a torpedo\r\n'b'placed at the bottom of the canal, who saved Herbert from certain death\r\n'b'by bringing the sulphate of quinine; and finally, it was he who had\r\n'b'killed the convicts with the electric balls, of which he possessed the\r\n'b'secret, and which he employed in the chase of submarine creatures. Thus\r\n'b'were explained so many apparently supernatural occurrences, and which\r\n'b'all proved the generosity and power of the captain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nevertheless, this noble misanthrope longed to benefit his proteges\r\n'b'still further. There yet remained much useful advice to give them, and,\r\n'b'his heart being softened by the approach of death, he invited, as we are\r\n'b'aware, the colonists of Granite House to visit the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus,\xe2\x80\x9d by means\r\n'b'of a wire which connected it with the corral. Possibly he would not\r\n'b'have done this had he been aware that Cyrus Harding was sufficiently\r\n'b'acquainted with his history to address him by the name of Nemo.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The captain concluded the narrative of his life. Cyrus Harding then\r\n'b'spoke; he recalled all the incidents which had exercised so beneficent\r\n'b'an influence upon the colony, and in the names of his companions and\r\n'b'himself thanked the generous being to whom they owed so much.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But Captain Nemo paid little attention; his mind appeared to be absorbed\r\n'b'by one idea, and without taking the proffered hand of the engineer,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNow, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d said he, \xe2\x80\x9cnow that you know my history, your judgment!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In saying this, the captain evidently alluded to an important incident\r\n'b'witnessed by the three strangers thrown on board his vessel, and which\r\n'b'the French professor had related in his work, causing a profound and\r\n'b'terrible sensation. Some days previous to the flight of the professor\r\n'b'and his two companions, the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus,\xe2\x80\x9d being chased by a frigate in the\r\n'b'north of the Atlantic had hurled herself as a ram upon this frigate, and\r\n'b'sunk her without mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding understood the captain\xe2\x80\x99s allusion, and was silent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt was an enemy\xe2\x80\x99s frigate,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Captain Nemo, transformed for\r\n'b'an instant into the Prince Dakkar, \xe2\x80\x9can enemy\xe2\x80\x99s frigate! It was she who\r\n'b'attacked me--I was in a narrow and shallow bay--the frigate barred my\r\n'b'way--and I sank her!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few moments of silence ensued; then the captain demanded,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat think you of my life, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding extended his hand to the ci-devant prince and replied\r\n'b'gravely, \xe2\x80\x9cSir, your error was in supposing that the past can be\r\n'b'resuscitated, and in contending against inevitable progress. It is one\r\n'b'of those errors which some admire, others blame; which God alone can\r\n'b'judge. He who is mistaken in an action which he sincerely believes to be\r\n'b'right may be an enemy, but retains our esteem. Your error is one that\r\n'b'we may admire, and your name has nothing to fear from the judgment of\r\n'b'history, which does not condemn heroic folly, but its results.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The old man\xe2\x80\x99s breast swelled with emotion, and raising his hand to\r\n'b'heaven,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWas I wrong, or in the right?\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding replied, \xe2\x80\x9cAll great actions return to God, from whom they\r\n'b'are derived. Captain Nemo, we, whom you have succored, shall ever mourn\r\n'b'your loss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert, who had drawn near the captain, fell on his knees and kissed\r\n'b'his hand.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A tear glistened in the eyes of the dying man. \xe2\x80\x9cMy child,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, \xe2\x80\x9cmay\r\n'b'God bless you!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 17\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Day had returned. No ray of light penetrated into the profundity of the\r\n'b'cavern. It being high-water, the entrance was closed by the sea. But the\r\n'b'artificial light, which escaped in long streams from the skylights of\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d was as vivid as before, and the sheet of water shone\r\n'b'around the floating vessel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An extreme exhaustion now overcame Captain Nemo, who had fallen back\r\n'b'upon the divan. It was useless to contemplate removing him to Granite\r\n'b'House, for he had expressed his wish to remain in the midst of those\r\n'b'marvels of the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d which millions could not have purchased, and\r\n'b'to wait there for that death which was swiftly approaching.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During a long interval of prostration, which rendered him almost\r\n'b'unconscious, Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett attentively observed\r\n'b'the condition of the dying man. It was apparent that his strength was\r\n'b'gradually diminishing. That frame, once so robust, was now but the\r\n'b'fragile tenement of a departing soul. All of life was concentrated in\r\n'b'the heart and head.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer and reporter consulted in whispers. Was it possible to\r\n'b'render any aid to the dying man? Might his life, if not saved, be\r\n'b'prolonged for some days? He himself had said that no remedy could\r\n'b'avail, and he awaited with tranquillity that death which had for him no\r\n'b'terrors.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe can do nothing,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut of what is he dying?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Pencroft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLife is simply fading out,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d said the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cif we move him into the open air, and\r\n'b'the light of the sun, he might perhaps recover.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cit is useless to attempt it.\r\n'b'Besides, Captain Nemo would never consent to leave his vessel. He\r\n'b'has lived for a dozen years on board the \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus,\xe2\x80\x99 and on board the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Nautilus\xe2\x80\x99 he desires to die.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Without doubt Captain Nemo heard Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s reply, for he raised\r\n'b'himself slightly, and in a voice more feeble, but always intelligible,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou are right, sir,\xe2\x80\x9d he said. \xe2\x80\x9cI shall die here--it is my wish; and\r\n'b'therefore I have a request to make of you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions had drawn near the divan, and now\r\n'b'arranged the cushions in such a manner as to better support the dying\r\n'b'man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They saw his eyes wander over all the marvels of this saloon, lighted\r\n'b'by the electric rays which fell from the arabesques of the luminous\r\n'b'ceiling. He surveyed, one after the other, the pictures hanging from\r\n'b'the splendid tapestries of the partitions, the chef-d\xe2\x80\x99oeuvres of the\r\n'b'Italian, Flemish, French, and Spanish masters; the statues of marble and\r\n'b'bronze on their pedestals; the magnificent organ, leaning against the\r\n'b'after-partition; the aquarium, in which bloomed the most wonderful\r\n'b'productions of the sea--marine plants, zoophytes, chaplets of pearls\r\n'b'of inestimable value; and, finally, his eyes rested on this device,\r\n'b'inscribed over the pediment of the museum--the motto of the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMobilis in mobile.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'His glance seemed to rest fondly for the last time on these masterpieces\r\n'b'of art and of nature, to which he had limited his horizon during a\r\n'b'sojourn of so many years in the abysses of the seas.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding respected the captain\xe2\x80\x99s silence, and waited till he should\r\n'b'speak.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After some minutes, during which, doubtless, he passed in review his\r\n'b'whole life, Captain Nemo turned to the colonists and said,\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou consider yourselves, gentlemen, under some obligations to me?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain, believe us that we would give our lives to prolong yours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPromise, then,\xe2\x80\x9d continued Captain Nemo, \xe2\x80\x9cto carry out my last wishes,\r\n'b'and I shall be repaid for all I have done for you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe promise,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And by this promise he bound both himself and his companions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cto-morrow I shall be dead.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert was about to utter an exclamation, but a sign from the captain\r\n'b'arrested him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow I shall die, and I desire no other tomb than the \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus.\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'It is my grave! All my friends repose in the depths of the ocean; their\r\n'b'resting-place shall be mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'These words were received with profound silence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPay attention to my wishes,\xe2\x80\x9d he continued. \xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus\xe2\x80\x99 is\r\n'b'imprisoned in this grotto, the entrance of which is blocked up; but,\r\n'b'although egress is impossible, the vessel may at least sink in the\r\n'b'abyss, and there bury my remains.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists listened reverently to the words of the dying man.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow, after my death, Mr. Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cyourself and companions will leave the \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus,\xe2\x80\x99 for all the\r\n'b'treasures it contains must perish with me. One token alone will remain\r\n'b'with you of Prince Dakkar, with whose history you are now acquainted.\r\n'b'That coffer yonder contains diamonds of the value of many millions,\r\n'b'most of them mementoes of the time when, husband and father, I thought\r\n'b'happiness possible for me, and a collection of pearls gathered by my\r\n'b'friends and myself in the depths of the ocean. Of this treasure at a\r\n'b'future day, you may make good use. In the hands of such men as yourself\r\n'b'and your comrades, Captain Harding, money will never be a source of\r\n'b'danger. From on high I shall still participate in your enterprises, and\r\n'b'I fear not but that they will prosper.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After a few moments\xe2\x80\x99 repose, necessitated by his extreme weakness,\r\n'b'Captain Nemo continued,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo-morrow you will take the coffer, you will leave the saloon, of which\r\n'b'you will close the door; then you will ascend on to the deck of the\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Nautilus,\xe2\x80\x99 and you will lower the mainhatch so as entirely to close the\r\n'b'vessel.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt shall be done, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood. You will then embark in the canoe which brought you hither; but,\r\n'b'before leaving the \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus,\xe2\x80\x99 go to the stern and there open two large\r\n'b'stop-cocks which you will find upon the water-line. The water will\r\n'b'penetrate into the reservoirs, and the \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus\xe2\x80\x99 will gradually sink\r\n'b'beneath the water to repose at the bottom of the abyss.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And comprehending a gesture of Cyrus Harding, the captain added,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cFear nothing! You will but bury a corpse!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Neither Cyrus Harding nor his companions ventured to offer any\r\n'b'observation to Captain Nemo. He had expressed his last wishes, and they\r\n'b'had nothing to do but to conform to them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI have your promise, gentlemen?\xe2\x80\x9d added Captain Nemo.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The captain thanked the colonists by a sign, and requested them to leave\r\n'b'him for some hours. Gideon Spilett wished to remain near him, in the\r\n'b'event of a crisis coming on, but the dying man refused, saying, \xe2\x80\x9cI shall\r\n'b'live until to-morrow, sir.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All left the saloon, passed through the library and the dining-room, and\r\n'b'arrived forward, in the machine-room where the electrical apparatus was\r\n'b'established, which supplied not only heat and light, but the mechanical\r\n'b'power of the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d was a masterpiece containing masterpieces within itself,\r\n'b'and the engineer was struck with astonishment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists mounted the platform, which rose seven or eight feet above\r\n'b'the water. There they beheld a thick glass lenticular covering, which\r\n'b'protected a kind of large eye, from which flashed forth light. Behind\r\n'b'this eye was apparently a cabin containing the wheels of the rudder, and\r\n'b'in which was stationed the helmsman, when he navigated the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' over the bed of the ocean, which the electric rays would evidently light\r\n'b'up to a considerable distance.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions remained for a time silent, for they\r\n'b'were vividly impressed by what they had just seen and heard, and their\r\n'b'hearts were deeply touched by the thought that he whose arm had so often\r\n'b'aided them, the protector whom they had known but a few hours, was at\r\n'b'the point of death.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Whatever might be the judgment pronounced by posterity upon the events\r\n'b'of this, so to speak, extra-human existence, the character of Prince\r\n'b'Dakkar would ever remain as one of those whose memory time can never\r\n'b'efface.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat a man!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft. \xe2\x80\x9cIs it possible that he can have lived at\r\n'b'the bottom of the sea? And it seems to me that perhaps he has not found\r\n'b'peace there any more than elsewhere!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus,\xe2\x80\x99\xe2\x80\x9d observed Ayrton, \xe2\x80\x9cmight have enabled us to leave\r\n'b'Lincoln Island and reach some inhabited country.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood Heavens!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cI for one would never risk myself\r\n'b'in such a craft. To sail on the seas, good, but under the seas, never!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI believe, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cthat the navigation of a\r\n'b'submarine vessel such as the \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus\xe2\x80\x99 ought to be very easy, and that\r\n'b'we should soon become accustomed to it. There would be no storms, no\r\n'b'lee-shore to fear. At some feet beneath the surface the waters of the\r\n'b'ocean are as calm as those of a lake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat may be,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cbut I prefer a gale of wind on\r\n'b'board a well-found craft. A vessel is built to sail on the sea, and not\r\n'b'beneath it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cit is useless, at any rate as regards\r\n'b'the \xe2\x80\x98Nautilus,\xe2\x80\x99 to discuss the question of submarine vessels. The\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Nautilus\xe2\x80\x99 is not ours, and we have not the right to dispose of it.\r\n'b'Moreover, we could in no case avail ourselves of it. Independently of\r\n'b'the fact that it would be impossible to get it out of this cavern, whose\r\n'b'entrance is now closed by the uprising of the basaltic rocks, Captain\r\n'b'Nemo\xe2\x80\x99s wish is that it shall be buried with him. His wish is our law,\r\n'b'and we will fulfil it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'After a somewhat prolonged conversation, Cyrus Harding and his\r\n'b'companions again descended to the interior of the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus.\xe2\x80\x9d There they\r\n'b'took some refreshment and returned to the saloon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Nemo had somewhat rallied from the prostration which had\r\n'b'overcome him, and his eyes shone with their wonted fire. A faint smile\r\n'b'even curled his lips.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists drew around him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, \xe2\x80\x9cyou are brave and honest men. You\r\n'b'have devoted yourselves to the common weal. Often have I observed\r\n'b'your conduct. I have esteemed you--I esteem you still! Your hand, Mr.\r\n'b'Harding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding gave his hand to the captain, who clasped it\r\n'b'affectionately.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is well!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He resumed,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut enough of myself. I have to speak concerning yourselves, and this\r\n'b'Lincoln Island, upon which you have taken refuge. You now desire to\r\n'b'leave it?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo return, captain!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft quickly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo return, Pencroft?\xe2\x80\x9d said the captain, with a smile. \xe2\x80\x9cI know, it is\r\n'b'true, your love for this island. You have helped to make it what it now\r\n'b'is, and it seems to you a paradise!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOur project, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d interposed Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cis to annex it to the\r\n'b'United States, and to establish for our shipping a port so fortunately\r\n'b'situated in this part of the Pacific.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYour thoughts are with your country, gentlemen,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the captain;\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cyour toils are for her prosperity and glory. You are right. One\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'native land!--there should one live! there die! And I die far from all I\r\n'b'loved!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYou have some last wish to transmit,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer with emotion,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9csome souvenir to send to those friends you have left in the mountains\r\n'b'of India?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNo, Captain Harding; no friends remain to me! I am the last of my race,\r\n'b'and to all whom I have known I have long been as are the dead.--But\r\n'b'to return to yourselves. Solitude, isolation, are painful things, and\r\n'b'beyond human endurance. I die of having thought it possible to live\r\n'b'alone! You should, therefore, dare all in the attempt to leave Lincoln\r\n'b'Island, and see once more the land of your birth. I am aware that those\r\n'b'wretches have destroyed the vessel you have built.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe propose to construct a vessel,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9csufficiently\r\n'b'large to convey us to the nearest land; but if we should succeed, sooner\r\n'b'or later we shall return to Lincoln Island. We are attached to it by too\r\n'b'many recollections ever to forget it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is here that we have known Captain Nemo,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is here only that we can make our home!\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd here shall I sleep the sleep of eternity, if--\xe2\x80\x9d replied the\r\n'b'captain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He paused for a moment, and, instead of completing the sentence, said\r\n'b'simply,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMr. Harding, I wish to speak with you--alone!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s companions, respecting the wish, retired.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding remained but a few minutes alone with Captain Nemo, and\r\n'b'soon recalled his companions; but he said nothing to them of the private\r\n'b'matters which the dying man had confided to him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett now watched the captain with extreme care. It was evident\r\n'b'that he was no longer sustained by his moral energy, which had lost the\r\n'b'power of reaction against his physical weakness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The day closed without change. The colonists did not quit the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' for a moment. Night arrived, although it was impossible to distinguish\r\n'b'it from day in the cavern.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Captain Nemo suffered no pain, but he was visibly sinking. His noble\r\n'b'features, paled by the approach of death, were perfectly calm. Inaudible\r\n'b'words escaped at intervals from his lips, bearing upon various incidents\r\n'b'of his checkered career. Life was evidently ebbing slowly and his\r\n'b'extremities were already cold.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Once or twice more he spoke to the colonists who stood around him, and\r\n'b'smiled on them with that last smile which continues after death.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At length, shortly after midnight, Captain Nemo by a supreme effort\r\n'b'succeeded in folding his arms across his breast, as if wishing in that\r\n'b'attitude to compose himself for death.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'By one o\xe2\x80\x99clock his glance alone showed signs of life. A dying light\r\n'b'gleamed in those eyes once so brilliant. Then, murmuring the words, \xe2\x80\x9cGod\r\n'b'and my country!\xe2\x80\x9d he quietly expired.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, bending low closed the eyes of him who had once been the\r\n'b'Prince Dakkar, and was now not even Captain Nemo.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert and Pencroft sobbed aloud. Tears fell from Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s eyes. Neb\r\n'b'was on his knees by the reporter\xe2\x80\x99s side, motionless as a statue.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then Cyrus Harding, extending his hand over the forehead of the dead,\r\n'b'said solemnly, \xe2\x80\x9cMay his soul be with God!\xe2\x80\x9d Turning to his friends, he\r\n'b'added, \xe2\x80\x9cLet us pray for him whom we have lost!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Some hours later the colonists fulfilled the promise made to the captain\r\n'b'by carrying out his dying wishes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions quitted the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus,\xe2\x80\x9d taking with\r\n'b'them the only memento left them by their benefactor, the coffer which\r\n'b'contained wealth amounting to millions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The marvelous saloon, still flooded with light, had been carefully\r\n'b'closed. The iron door leading on deck was then securely fastened in\r\n'b'such a manner as to prevent even a drop of water from penetrating to the\r\n'b'interior of the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists then descended into the canoe, which was moored to the\r\n'b'side of the submarine vessel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The canoe was now brought around to the stern. There, at the water-line,\r\n'b'were two large stop-cocks communicating with the reservoirs employed in\r\n'b'the submersion of the vessel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The stop-cocks were opened, the reservoirs filled, and the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' slowly sinking, disappeared beneath the surface of the lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But the colonists were yet able to follow its descent through the waves.\r\n'b'The powerful light it gave forth lighted up the translucent water, while\r\n'b'the cavern became gradually obscure. At length this vast effusion of\r\n'b'electric light faded away, and soon after the \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus,\xe2\x80\x9d now the tomb\r\n'b'of Captain Nemo, reposed in its ocean bed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 18\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At break of day the colonists regained in silence the entrance of the\r\n'b'cavern, to which they gave the name of \xe2\x80\x9cDakkar Grotto,\xe2\x80\x9d in memory of\r\n'b'Captain Nemo. It was now low-water, and they passed without difficulty\r\n'b'under the arcade, washed on the right by the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The canoe was left here, carefully protected from the waves. As\r\n'b'additional precaution, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton drew it up on a little\r\n'b'beach which bordered one of the sides of the grotto, in a spot where it\r\n'b'could run no risk of harm.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The storm had ceased during the night. The last low mutterings of the\r\n'b'thunder died away in the west. Rain fell no longer, but the sky was yet\r\n'b'obscured by clouds. On the whole, this month of October, the first of\r\n'b'the southern spring, was not ushered in by satisfactory tokens, and the\r\n'b'wind had a tendency to shift from one point of the compass to another,\r\n'b'which rendered it impossible to count upon settled weather.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and his companions, on leaving Dakkar Grotto, had taken\r\n'b'the road to the corral. On their way Neb and Herbert were careful to\r\n'b'preserve the wire which had been laid down by the captain between the\r\n'b'corral and the grotto, and which might at a future time be of service.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists spoke but little on the road. The various incidents of the\r\n'b'night of October 15th had left a profound impression on their minds. The\r\n'b'unknown being whose influence had so effectually protected them, the\r\n'b'man whom their imagination had endowed with supernatural powers, Captain\r\n'b'Nemo, was no more. His \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d and he were buried in the depths of\r\n'b'the abyss. To each one of them their existence seemed even more isolated\r\n'b'than before. They had been accustomed to count upon the intervention of\r\n'b'that power which existed no longer, and Gideon Spilett, and even Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding, could not escape this impression. Thus they maintained a\r\n'b'profound silence during their journey to the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards nine in the morning the colonists arrived at Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It had been agreed that the construction of the vessel should be\r\n'b'actively pushed forward, and Cyrus Harding more than ever devoted his\r\n'b'time and labor to this object. It was impossible to divine what future\r\n'b'lay before them. Evidently the advantage to the colonists would be great\r\n'b'of having at their disposal a substantial vessel, capable of keeping the\r\n'b'sea even in heavy weather, and large enough to attempt, in case of\r\n'b'need, a voyage of some duration. Even if, when their vessel should be\r\n'b'completed, the colonists should not resolve to leave Lincoln Island as\r\n'b'yet, in order to gain either one of the Polynesian Archipelagoes of the\r\n'b'Pacific or the shores of New Zealand, they might at least, sooner or\r\n'b'later, proceed to Tabor Island, to leave there the notice relating to\r\n'b'Ayrton. This was a precaution rendered indispensable by the possibility\r\n'b'of the Scotch yacht reappearing in those seas, and it was of the highest\r\n'b'importance that nothing should be neglected on this point.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The works were then resumed. Cyrus Harding, Pencroft, and Ayrton,\r\n'b'assisted by Neb, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert, except when unavoidably\r\n'b'called off by other necessary occupations, worked without cessation. It\r\n'b'was important that the new vessel should be ready in five months--that\r\n'b'is to say, by the beginning of March--if they wished to visit Tabor\r\n'b'Island before the equinoctial gales rendered the voyage impracticable.\r\n'b'Therefore the carpenters lost not a moment. Moreover, it was unnecessary\r\n'b'to manufacture rigging, that of the \xe2\x80\x9cSpeedy\xe2\x80\x9d having been saved entire,\r\n'b'so that the hull only of the vessel needed to be constructed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The end of the year 1868 found them occupied by these important labors,\r\n'b'to the exclusion of almost all others. At the expiration of two months\r\n'b'and a half the ribs had been set up and the first planks adjusted. It\r\n'b'was already evident that the plans made by Cyrus Harding were admirable,\r\n'b'and that the vessel would behave well at sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft brought to the task a devouring energy, and would even grumble\r\n'b'when one or the other abandoned the carpenter\xe2\x80\x99s axe for the gun of the\r\n'b'hunter. It was nevertheless necessary to keep up the stores of Granite\r\n'b'House, in view of the approaching winter. But this did not satisfy\r\n'b'Pencroft. The brave, honest sailor was not content when the workmen were\r\n'b'not at the dockyard. When this happened he grumbled vigorously, and, by\r\n'b'way of venting his feelings, did the work of six men.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The weather was very unfavorable during the whole of the summer season.\r\n'b'For some days the heat was overpowering, and the atmosphere, saturated\r\n'b'with electricity, was only cleared by violent storms. It was rarely that\r\n'b'the distant growling of the thunder could not be heard, like a low but\r\n'b'incessant murmur, such as is produced in the equatorial regions of the\r\n'b'globe.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The 1st of January, 1869, was signalized by a storm of extreme violence,\r\n'b'and the thunder burst several times over the island. Large trees were\r\n'b'struck by the electric fluid and shattered, and among others one of\r\n'b'those gigantic nettle-trees which had shaded the poultry-yard at the\r\n'b'southern extremity of the lake. Had this meteor any relation to the\r\n'b'phenomena going on in the bowels of the earth? Was there any connection\r\n'b'between the commotion of the atmosphere and that of the interior of the\r\n'b'earth? Cyrus Harding was inclined to think that such was the case, for\r\n'b'the development of these storms was attended by the renewal of volcanic\r\n'b'symptoms.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was on the 3rd of January that Herbert, having ascended at daybreak\r\n'b'to the plateau of Prospect Heights to harness one of the onagers,\r\n'b'perceived an enormous hat-shaped cloud rolling from the summit of the\r\n'b'volcano.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Herbert immediately apprised the colonists, who at once joined him in\r\n'b'watching the summit of Mount Franklin.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthose are not vapors this time! It seems to\r\n'b'me that the giant is not content with breathing; he must smoke!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This figure of speech employed by the sailor exactly expressed the\r\n'b'changes going on at the mouth of the volcano. Already for three months\r\n'b'had the crater emitted vapors more or less dense, but which were as yet\r\n'b'produced only by an internal ebullition of mineral substances. But\r\n'b'now the vapors were replaced by a thick smoke, rising in the form of a\r\n'b'grayish column, more than three hundred feet in width at its base, and\r\n'b'which spread like an immense mushroom to a height of from seven to eight\r\n'b'hundred feet above the summit of the mountain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe fire is in the chimney,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd we can\xe2\x80\x99t put it out!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe volcano ought to be swept,\xe2\x80\x9d observed Neb, who spoke as if perfectly\r\n'b'serious.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell said, Neb!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, with a shout of laughter; \xe2\x80\x9cand you\xe2\x80\x99ll\r\n'b'undertake the job, no doubt?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding attentively observed the dense smoke emitted by Mount\r\n'b'Franklin, and even listened, as if expecting to hear some distant\r\n'b'muttering. Then, turning towards his companions, from whom he had gone\r\n'b'somewhat apart, he said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe truth is, my friends, we must not conceal from ourselves that an\r\n'b'important change is going forward. The volcanic substances are no longer\r\n'b'in a state of ebullition, they have caught fire, and we are undoubtedly\r\n'b'menaced by an approaching eruption.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, captain,\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall witness the eruption; and if\r\n'b'it is a good one, we\xe2\x80\x99ll applaud it. I don\xe2\x80\x99t see that we need concern\r\n'b'ourselves further about the matter.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt may be so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cfor the ancient track of\r\n'b'the lava is still open; and thanks to this, the crater has hitherto\r\n'b'overflowed towards the north. And yet--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAnd yet, as we can derive no advantage from an eruption, it might be\r\n'b'better it should not take place,\xe2\x80\x9d said the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWho knows?\xe2\x80\x9d answered the sailor. \xe2\x80\x9cPerhaps there may be some valuable\r\n'b'substance in this volcano, which it will spout forth, and which we may\r\n'b'turn to good account!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding shook his head with the air of a man who augured no good\r\n'b'from the phenomenon whose development had been so sudden. He did not\r\n'b'regard so lightly as Pencroft the results of an eruption. If the lava,\r\n'b'in consequence of the position of the crater, did not directly menace\r\n'b'the wooded and cultivated parts of the island, other complications might\r\n'b'present themselves. In fact, eruptions are not unfrequently accompanied\r\n'b'by earthquakes; and an island of the nature of Lincoln Island, formed of\r\n'b'substances so varied, basalt on one side, granite on the other, lava on\r\n'b'the north, rich soil on the south, substances which consequently could\r\n'b'not be firmly attached to each other, would be exposed to the risk\r\n'b'of disintegration. Although, therefore, the spreading of the volcanic\r\n'b'matter might not constitute a serious danger, any movement of the\r\n'b'terrestrial structure which should shake the island might entail the\r\n'b'gravest consequences.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt seems to me,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ayrton, who had reclined so as to place his ear\r\n'b'to the ground, \xe2\x80\x9cit seems to me that I can hear a dull, rumbling sound,\r\n'b'like that of a wagon loaded with bars of iron.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists listened with the greatest attention, and were convinced\r\n'b'that Ayrton was not mistaken. The rumbling was mingled with a\r\n'b'subterranean roar, which formed a sort of rinforzando, and died slowly\r\n'b'away, as if some violent storm had passed through the profundities of\r\n'b'the globe. But no explosion properly so termed, could be heard. It might\r\n'b'therefore be concluded that the vapors and smoke found a free passage\r\n'b'through the central shaft; and that the safety-valve being sufficiently\r\n'b'large, no convulsion would be produced, no explosion was to be\r\n'b'apprehended.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9care we not going back to work? Let Mount\r\n'b'Franklin smoke, groan, bellow, or spout forth fire and flame as much as\r\n'b'it pleases, that is no reason why we should be idle! Come, Ayrton, Neb,\r\n'b'Herbert, Captain Harding, Mr. Spilett, every one of us must turn to at\r\n'b'our work to-day! We are going to place the keelson, and a dozen pair\r\n'b'of hands would not be too many. Before two months I want our new\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99--for we shall keep the old name, shall we not?--to float\r\n'b'on the waters of Port Balloon! Therefore there is not an hour to lose!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All the colonists, their services thus requisitioned by Pencroft,\r\n'b'descended to the dockyard, and proceeded to place the keelson, a thick\r\n'b'mass of wood which forms the lower portion of a ship and unites firmly\r\n'b'the timbers of the hull. It was an arduous undertaking, in which all\r\n'b'took part.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'They continued their labors during the whole of this day, the 3rd of\r\n'b'January, without thinking further of the volcano, which could not,\r\n'b'besides, be seen from the shore of Granite House. But once or twice,\r\n'b'large shadows, veiling the sun, which described its diurnal arc through\r\n'b'an extremely clear sky, indicated that a thick cloud of smoke passed\r\n'b'between its disc and the island. The wind, blowing on the shore, carried\r\n'b'all these vapors to the westward. Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett\r\n'b'remarked these somber appearances, and from time to time discussed\r\n'b'the evident progress of the volcanic phenomena, but their work went\r\n'b'on without interruption. It was, besides, of the first importance from\r\n'b'every point of view, that the vessel should be finished with the least\r\n'b'possible delay. In presence of the eventualities which might arise,\r\n'b'the safety of the colonists would be to a great extent secured by their\r\n'b'ship. Who could tell that it might not prove some day their only refuge?\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In the evening, after supper, Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, and Herbert\r\n'b'again ascended the plateau of Prospect Heights. It was already dark, and\r\n'b'the obscurity would permit them to ascertain if flames or incandescent\r\n'b'matter thrown up by the volcano were mingled with the vapor and smoke\r\n'b'accumulated at the mouth of the crater.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe crater is on fire!\xe2\x80\x9d said Herbert, who, more active than his\r\n'b'companion, first reached the plateau.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Mount Franklin, distant about six miles, now appeared like a gigantic\r\n'b'torch, around the summit of which turned fuliginous flames. So much\r\n'b'smoke, and possibly scoriae and cinders were mingled with them, that\r\n'b'their light gleamed but faintly amid the gloom of the night. But a kind\r\n'b'of lurid brilliancy spread over the island, against which stood out\r\n'b'confusedly the wooded masses of the heights. Immense whirlwinds of vapor\r\n'b'obscured the sky, through which glimmered a few stars.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe change is rapid!\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat is not surprising,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the reporter. \xe2\x80\x9cThe reawakening of the\r\n'b'volcano already dates back some time. You may remember, Cyrus, that\r\n'b'the first vapors appeared about the time we searched the sides of the\r\n'b'mountain to discover Captain Nemo\xe2\x80\x99s retreat. It was, if I mistake not,\r\n'b'about the 15th of October.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Herbert, \xe2\x80\x9ctwo months and a half ago!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe subterranean fires have therefore been smoldering for ten weeks,\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b' resumed Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cand it is not to be wondered at that they now\r\n'b'break out with such violence!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo not you feel a certain vibration of the soil?\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Gideon Spilett, \xe2\x80\x9cbut there is a great difference between\r\n'b'that and an earthquake.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI do not affirm that we are menaced with an earthquake,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cmay God preserve us from that! No; these vibrations are due to\r\n'b'the effervescence of the central fire. The crust of the earth is\r\n'b'simply the shell of a boiler, and you know that such a shell, under the\r\n'b'pressure of steam, vibrates like a sonorous plate. It is this effect\r\n'b'which is being produced at this moment.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWhat magnificent flames!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this instant a kind of bouquet of flames shot forth from the crater,\r\n'b'the brilliancy of which was visible even through the vapors. Thousands\r\n'b'of luminous sheets and barbed tongues of fire were cast in various\r\n'b'directions. Some, extending beyond the dome of smoke, dissipated\r\n'b'it, leaving behind an incandescent powder. This was accompanied\r\n'b'by successive explosions, resembling the discharge of a battery of\r\n'b'machine-guns.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, the reporter, and Herbert, after spending an hour on the\r\n'b'plateau of Prospect Heights, again descended to the beach, and returned\r\n'b'to Granite House. The engineer was thoughtful and preoccupied, so much\r\n'b'so, indeed, that Gideon Spilett inquired if he apprehended any immediate\r\n'b'danger, of which the eruption might directly or indirectly be the cause.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and no,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNevertheless,\xe2\x80\x9d continued the reporter, \xe2\x80\x9cwould not the greatest\r\n'b'misfortune which could happen to us be an earthquake which would\r\n'b'overturn the island? Now, I do not suppose that this is to be feared,\r\n'b'since the vapors and lava have found a free outlet.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTrue,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cand I do not fear an earthquake in the\r\n'b'sense in which the term is commonly applied to convulsions of the soil\r\n'b'provoked by the expansion of subterranean gases. But other causes may\r\n'b'produce great disasters.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow so, my dear Cyrus?\xe2\x80\x99\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI am not certain. I must consider. I must visit the mountain. In a few\r\n'b'days I shall learn more on this point.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Gideon Spilett said no more, and soon, in spite of the explosions of\r\n'b'the volcano, whose intensity increased, and which were repeated by the\r\n'b'echoes of the island, the inhabitants of Granite House were sleeping\r\n'b'soundly.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Three days passed by--the 4th, 5th, and 6th of January. The construction\r\n'b'of the vessel was diligently continued, and without offering further\r\n'b'explanations the engineer pushed forward the work with all his energy.\r\n'b'Mount Franklin was now hooded by a somber cloud of sinister aspect, and,\r\n'b'amid the flames, vomiting forth incandescent rocks, some of which fell\r\n'b'back into the crater itself. This caused Pencroft, who would only look\r\n'b'at the matter in the light of a joke, to exclaim,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh! the giant is playing at cup and ball; he is a conjurer.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, the substances thrown up fell back again in to the abyss, and\r\n'b'it did not seem that the lava, though swollen by the internal pressure,\r\n'b'had yet risen to the orifice of the crater. At any rate, the opening on\r\n'b'the northeast, which was partly visible, poured out no torrent upon the\r\n'b'northern slope of the mountain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nevertheless, however pressing was the construction of the vessel, other\r\n'b'duties demanded the presence of the colonists on various portions of the\r\n'b'island. Before everything it was necessary to go to the corral, where\r\n'b'the flocks of musmons and goats were enclosed, and replenish the\r\n'b'provision of forage for those animals. It was accordingly arranged that\r\n'b'Ayrton should proceed thither the next day, the 7th of January; and as\r\n'b'he was sufficient for the task, to which he was accustomed, Pencroft and\r\n'b'the rest were somewhat surprised on hearing the engineer say to Ayrton--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAs you are going to-morrow to the corral I will accompany you.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cour working days will not\r\n'b'be many, and if you go also we shall be two pair of hands short!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall return to-morrow,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cbut it is necessary\r\n'b'that I should go to the corral. I must learn how the eruption is\r\n'b'progressing.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe eruption! always the eruption!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Pencroft, with an air of\r\n'b'discontent. \xe2\x80\x9cAn important thing, truly, this eruption! I trouble myself\r\n'b'very little about it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Whatever might be the sailor\xe2\x80\x99s opinion, the expedition projected by the\r\n'b'engineer was settled for the next day. Herbert wished to accompany Cyrus\r\n'b'Harding, but he would not vex Pencroft by his absence.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, at dawn, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, mounting the cart drawn\r\n'b'by two onagers, took the road to the corral and set off at a round trot.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Above the forest were passing large clouds, to which the crater of Mount\r\n'b'Franklin incessantly added fuliginous matter. These clouds, which rolled\r\n'b'heavily in the air, were evidently composed of heterogeneous substances.\r\n'b'It was not alone from the volcano that they derived their strange\r\n'b'opacity and weight. Scoriae, in a state of dust, like powdered\r\n'b'pumice-stone, and grayish ashes as small as the finest feculae, were\r\n'b'held in suspension in the midst of their thick folds. These ashes are so\r\n'b'fine that they have been observed in the air for whole months. After\r\n'b'the eruption of 1783 in Iceland for upwards of a year the atmosphere was\r\n'b'thus charged with volcanic dust through which the rays of the sun were\r\n'b'only with difficulty discernible.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But more often this pulverized matter falls, and this happened on the\r\n'b'present occasion. Cyrus Harding and Ayrton had scarcely reached the\r\n'b'corral when a sort of black snow like fine gunpowder fell, and instantly\r\n'b'changed the appearance of the soil. Trees, meadows, all disappeared\r\n'b'beneath a covering several inches in depth. But, very fortunately,\r\n'b'the wind blew from the northeast, and the greater part of the cloud\r\n'b'dissolved itself over the sea.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is very singular, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is very serious,\xe2\x80\x9d replied the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cThis powdered pumice-stone,\r\n'b'all this mineral dust, proves how grave is the convulsion going forward\r\n'b'in the lower depths of the volcano.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut can nothing be done?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNothing, except to note the progress of the phenomenon. Do you,\r\n'b'therefore, Ayrton, occupy yourself with the necessary work at the\r\n'b'corral. In the meantime I will ascend just beyond the source of Red\r\n'b'Creek and examine the condition of the mountain upon its northern\r\n'b'aspect. Then--\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, Captain Harding?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThen we will pay a visit to Dakkar Grotto. I wish to inspect it. At any\r\n'b'rate I will come back for you in two hours.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton then proceeded to enter the corral, and, while awaiting the\r\n'b'engineer\xe2\x80\x99s return, busied himself with the musmons and goats which\r\n'b'seemed to feel a certain uneasiness in presence of these first signs of\r\n'b'an eruption.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile Cyrus Harding ascended the crest of the eastern spur, passed\r\n'b'Red Creek, and arrived at the spot where he and his companions had\r\n'b'discovered a sulphurous spring at the time of their first exploration.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'How changed was everything! Instead of a single column of smoke he\r\n'b'counted thirteen, forced through the soil as if violently propelled by\r\n'b'some piston. It was evident that the crust of the earth was subjected\r\n'b'in this part of the globe to a frightful pressure. The atmosphere was\r\n'b'saturated with gases and carbonic acid, mingled with aqueous vapors.\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding felt the volcanic tufa with which the plain was strewn,\r\n'b'and which was but pulverized cinders hardened into solid blocks by time,\r\n'b'tremble beneath him, but he could discover no traces of fresh lava.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer became more assured of this when he observed all the\r\n'b'northern part of Mount Franklin. Pillars of smoke and flame escaped from\r\n'b'the crater; a hail of scoriae fell on the ground; but no current of\r\n'b'lava burst from the mouth of the volcano, which proved that the volcanic\r\n'b'matter had not yet attained the level of the superior orifice of the\r\n'b'central shaft.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut I would prefer that it were so,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding to himself. \xe2\x80\x9cAt\r\n'b'any rate, I should then know that the lava had followed its accustomed\r\n'b'track. Who can say that it may not take a new course? But the danger\r\n'b'does not consist in that! Captain Nemo foresaw it clearly! No, the\r\n'b'danger does not lie there!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding advanced towards the enormous causeway whose prolongation\r\n'b'enclosed the narrow Shark Gulf. He could now sufficiently examine on\r\n'b'this side the ancient channels of the lava. There was no doubt in his\r\n'b'mind that the most recent eruption had occurred at a far-distant epoch.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'He then returned by the same way, listening attentively to the\r\n'b'subterranean mutterings which rolled like long-continued thunder,\r\n'b'interrupted by deafening explosions. At nine in the morning he reached\r\n'b'the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton awaited him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe animals are cared for, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d said Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood, Ayrton.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThey seem uneasy, Captain Harding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, instinct speaks through them, and instinct is never deceived.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAre you ready?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTake a lamp, Ayrton,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer; \xe2\x80\x9cwe will start at once.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton did as desired. The onagers, unharnessed, roamed in the corral.\r\n'b'The gate was secured on the outside, and Cyrus Harding, preceding\r\n'b'Ayrton, took the narrow path which led westward to the shore.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The soil they walked upon was choked with the pulverized matter fallen\r\n'b'from the cloud. No quadruped appeared in the woods. Even the birds had\r\n'b'fled. Sometimes a passing breeze raised the covering of ashes, and the\r\n'b'two colonists, enveloped in a whirlwind of dust, lost sight of each\r\n'b'other. They were then careful to cover their eyes and mouths with\r\n'b'handkerchiefs, for they ran the risk of being blinded and suffocated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was impossible for Cyrus Harding and Ayrton, with these impediments,\r\n'b'to make rapid progress. Moreover, the atmosphere was close, as if the\r\n'b'oxygen had been partly burned up, and had become unfit for respiration.\r\n'b'At every hundred paces they were obliged to stop to take breath. It was\r\n'b'therefore past ten o\xe2\x80\x99clock when the engineer and his companion reached\r\n'b'the crest of the enormous mass of rocks of basalt and porphyry which\r\n'b'composed the northwest coast of the island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton and Cyrus Harding commenced the descent of this abrupt declivity,\r\n'b'following almost step for step the difficult path which, during that\r\n'b'stormy night, had led them to Dakkar Grotto. In open day the descent was\r\n'b'less perilous, and, besides, the bed of ashes which covered the polished\r\n'b'surface of the rock enabled them to make their footing more secure.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The ridge at the end of the shore, about forty feet in height, was soon\r\n'b'reached. Cyrus Harding recollected that this elevation gradually sloped\r\n'b'towards the level of the sea. Although the tide was at present low, no\r\n'b'beach could be seen, and the waves, thickened by the volcanic dust, beat\r\n'b'upon the basaltic rocks.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding and Ayrton found without difficulty the entrance to Dakkar\r\n'b'Grotto, and paused for a moment at the last rock before it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe iron boat should be there,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is here, Captain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ayrton, drawing towards him the\r\n'b'fragile craft, which was protected by the arch of the vault.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cOn board, Ayrton!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The two colonists stepped into the boat. A slight undulation of the\r\n'b'waves carried it farther under the low arch of the crypt, and there\r\n'b'Ayrton, with the aid of flint and steel, lighted the lamp. He then took\r\n'b'the oars, and the lamp having been placed in the bow of the boat, so\r\n'b'that its rays fell before them, Cyrus Harding took the helm and steered\r\n'b'through the shades of the grotto.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The \xe2\x80\x9cNautilus\xe2\x80\x9d was there no longer to illuminate the cavern with its\r\n'b'electric light. Possibly it might not yet be extinguished, but no ray\r\n'b'escaped from the depths of the abyss in which reposed all that was\r\n'b'mortal of Captain Nemo.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The light afforded by the lamp, although feeble, nevertheless enabled\r\n'b'the engineer to advance slowly, following the wall of the cavern. A\r\n'b'deathlike silence reigned under the vaulted roof, or at least in the\r\n'b'anterior portion, for soon Cyrus Harding distinctly heard the rumbling\r\n'b'which proceeded from the bowels of the mountain.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThat comes from the volcano,\xe2\x80\x9d he said.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Besides these sounds, the presence of chemical combinations was soon\r\n'b'betrayed by their powerful odor, and the engineer and his companion were\r\n'b'almost suffocated by sulphurous vapors.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis is what Captain Nemo feared,\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Cyrus Harding, changing\r\n'b'countenance. \xe2\x80\x9cWe must go to the end, notwithstanding.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cForward!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Ayrton, bending to his oars and directing the boat\r\n'b'towards the head of the cavern.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Twenty-five minutes after entering the mouth of the grotto the boat\r\n'b'reached the extreme end.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding then, standing up, cast the light of the lamp upon the\r\n'b'walls of the cavern which separated it from the central shaft of the\r\n'b'volcano. What was the thickness of this wall? It might be ten feet or a\r\n'b'hundred feet--it was impossible to say. But the subterranean sounds were\r\n'b'too perceptible to allow of the supposition that it was of any great\r\n'b'thickness.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer, after having explored the wall at a certain height\r\n'b'horizontally, fastened the lamp to the end of an oar, and again surveyed\r\n'b'the basaltic wall at a greater elevation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There, through scarcely visible clefts and joinings, escaped a pungent\r\n'b'vapor, which infected the atmosphere of the cavern. The wall was broken\r\n'b'by large cracks, some of which extended to within two or three feet of\r\n'b'the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding thought for a brief space. Then he said in a low voice,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes! the captain was right! The danger lies there, and a terrible\r\n'b'danger!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Ayrton said not a word, but, upon a sign from Cyrus Harding, resumed the\r\n'b'oars, and half an hour later the engineer and he reached the entrance of\r\n'b'Dakkar Grotto.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 19\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The next day, the 8th day of January, after a day and night passed\r\n'b'at the corral, where they left all in order, Cyrus Harding and Ayrton\r\n'b'arrived at Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer immediately called his companions together, and informed\r\n'b'them of the imminent danger which threatened Lincoln Island, and from\r\n'b'which no human power could deliver them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d he said, and his voice betrayed the depth of his emotion,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cour island is not among those which will endure while this earth\r\n'b'endures. It is doomed to more or less speedy destruction, the cause of\r\n'b'which it bears within itself, and from which nothing can save it.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists looked at each other, then at the engineer. They did not\r\n'b'clearly comprehend him.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cExplain yourself, Cyrus!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will do so,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cor rather I will simply\r\n'b'afford you the explanation which, during our few minutes of private\r\n'b'conversation, was given me by Captain Nemo.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Nemo!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the colonists.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, and it was the last service he desired to render us before his\r\n'b'death!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe last service!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cthe last service! You will see\r\n'b'that though he is dead he will render us others yet!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cBut what did the captain say?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired the reporter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you, my friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cLincoln Island does\r\n'b'not resemble the other islands of the Pacific, and a fact of which\r\n'b'Captain Nemo has made me cognizant must sooner or later bring about the\r\n'b'subversion of its foundation.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNonsense! Lincoln Island, it can\xe2\x80\x99t be!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Pencroft, who, in spite\r\n'b'of the respect he felt for Cyrus Harding, could not prevent a gesture of\r\n'b'incredulity.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cListen, Pencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d resumed the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cI will tell you what Captain\r\n'b'Nemo communicated to me, and which I myself confirmed yesterday, during\r\n'b'the exploration of Dakkar Grotto.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThis cavern stretches under the island as far as the volcano, and is\r\n'b'only separated from its central shaft by the wall which terminates it.\r\n'b'Now, this wall is seamed with fissures and clefts which already allow\r\n'b'the sulphurous gases generated in the interior of the volcano to\r\n'b'escape.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell?\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, his brow suddenly contracting.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWell, then, I saw that these fissures widen under the internal pressure\r\n'b'from within, that the wall of basalt is gradually giving way and that\r\n'b'after a longer or shorter period it will afford a passage to the waters\r\n'b'of the lake which fill the cavern.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cGood!\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, with an attempt at pleasantry. \xe2\x80\x9cThe sea will\r\n'b'extinguish the volcano, and there will be an end of the matter!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNot so!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cshould a day arrive when the sea, rushing\r\n'b'through the wall of the cavern, penetrates by the central shaft into the\r\n'b'interior of the island to the boiling lava, Lincoln Island will that day\r\n'b'be blown into the air--just as would happen to the island of Sicily were\r\n'b'the Mediterranean to precipitate itself into Mount Etna.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists made no answer to these significant words of the engineer.\r\n'b'They now understood the danger by which they were menaced.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It may be added that Cyrus Harding had in no way exaggerated the danger\r\n'b'to be apprehended. Many persons have formed an idea that it would be\r\n'b'possible to extinguish volcanoes, which are almost always situated on\r\n'b'the shores of a sea or lake, by opening a passage for the admission of\r\n'b'the water. But they are not aware that this would be to incur the risk\r\n'b'of blowing up a portion of the globe, like a boiler whose steam is\r\n'b'suddenly expanded by intense heat. The water, rushing into a cavity\r\n'b'whose temperature might be estimated at thousands of degrees, would\r\n'b'be converted into steam with a sudden energy which no enclosure could\r\n'b'resist.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was not therefore doubtful that the island, menaced by a frightful\r\n'b'and approaching convulsion, would endure only so long as the wall\r\n'b'of Dakkar Grotto itself should endure. It was not even a question of\r\n'b'months, nor of weeks, but of days; it might be of hours.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first sentiment which the colonists felt was that of profound\r\n'b'sorrow. They thought not so much of the peril which menaced themselves\r\n'b'personally, but of the destruction of the island which had sheltered\r\n'b'them, which they had cultivated, which they loved so well, and had hoped\r\n'b'to render so flourishing. So much effort ineffectually expended, so much\r\n'b'labor lost.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft could not prevent a large tear from rolling down his cheek, nor\r\n'b'did he attempt to conceal it.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Some further conversation now took place. The chances yet in favor of\r\n'b'the colonists were discussed; but finally it was agreed that there was\r\n'b'not an hour to be lost, that the building and fitting of the vessel\r\n'b'should be pushed forward with their utmost energy, and that this was the\r\n'b'sole chance of safety for the inhabitants of Lincoln Island.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'All hands, therefore, set to work on the vessel. What could it avail\r\n'b'to sow, to reap, to hunt, to increase the stores of Granite House?\r\n'b'The contents of the storehouse and outbuildings contained more than\r\n'b'sufficient to provide the ship for a voyage, however long might be its\r\n'b'duration. But it was imperative that the ship should be ready to receive\r\n'b'them before the inevitable catastrophe should arrive.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Their labors were now carried on with feverish ardor. By the 23rd of\r\n'b'January the vessel was half-decked over. Up to this time no change had\r\n'b'taken place on the summit of the volcano. Vapor and smoke mingled with\r\n'b'flames and incandescent stones were thrown up from the crater. But\r\n'b'during the night of the 23rd, in consequence of the lava attaining the\r\n'b'level of the first stratum of the volcano, the hat-shaped cone which\r\n'b'formed over the latter disappeared. A frightful sound was heard. The\r\n'b'colonists at first thought the island was rent asunder, and rushed out\r\n'b'of Granite House.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This occurred about two o\xe2\x80\x99clock in the morning.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The sky appeared on fire. The superior cone, a mass of rock a thousand\r\n'b'feet in height, and weighing thousands of millions of pounds, had\r\n'b'been thrown down upon the island, making it tremble to its foundation.\r\n'b'Fortunately, this cone inclined to the north, and had fallen upon the\r\n'b'plain of sand and tufa stretching between the volcano and the sea. The\r\n'b'aperture of the crater being thus enlarged projected towards the sky a\r\n'b'glare so intense that by the simple effect of reflection the atmosphere\r\n'b'appeared red-hot. At the same time a torrent of lava, bursting from the\r\n'b'new summit, poured out in long cascades, like water escaping from a vase\r\n'b'too full, and a thousand tongues of fire crept over the sides of the\r\n'b'volcano.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe corral! the corral!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Ayrton.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was, in fact, towards the corral that the lava was rushing as the\r\n'b'new crater faced the east, and consequently the fertile portions of the\r\n'b'island, the springs of Red Creek and Jacamar Wood, were menaced with\r\n'b'instant destruction.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s cry the colonists rushed to the onagers\xe2\x80\x99 stables. The cart\r\n'b'was at once harnessed. All were possessed by the same thought--to hasten\r\n'b'to the corral and set at liberty the animals it enclosed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Before three in the morning they arrived at the corral. The cries of the\r\n'b'terrified musmons and goats indicated the alarm which possessed them.\r\n'b'Already a torrent of burning matter and liquefied minerals fell from\r\n'b'the side of the mountain upon the meadows as far as the side of the\r\n'b'palisade. The gate was burst open by Ayrton, and the animals, bewildered\r\n'b'with terror, fled in all directions.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An hour afterwards the boiling lava filled the corral, converting into\r\n'b'vapor the water of the little rivulet which ran through it, burning up\r\n'b'the house like dry grass, and leaving not even a post of the palisade to\r\n'b'mark the spot where the corral once stood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'To contend against this disaster would have been folly--nay, madness. In\r\n'b'presence of Nature\xe2\x80\x99s grand convulsions man is powerless.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was now daylight--the 24th of January. Cyrus Harding and his\r\n'b'companions, before returning to Granite House, desired to ascertain the\r\n'b'probable direction this inundation of lava was about to take. The soil\r\n'b'sloped gradually from Mount Franklin to the east coast, and it was to be\r\n'b'feared that, in spite of the thick Jacamar Wood, the torrent would reach\r\n'b'the plateau of Prospect Heights.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe lake will cover us,\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI hope so!\xe2\x80\x9d was Cyrus Harding\xe2\x80\x99s only reply.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists were desirous of reaching the plain upon which the\r\n'b'superior cone of Mount Franklin had fallen, but the lava arrested their\r\n'b'progress. It had followed, on one side, the valley of Red Creek, and\r\n'b'on the other that of Falls River, evaporating those watercourses in its\r\n'b'passage. There was no possibility of crossing the torrent of lava;\r\n'b'on the contrary, the colonists were obliged to retreat before it. The\r\n'b'volcano, without its crown, was no longer recognizable, terminated as it\r\n'b'was by a sort of flat table which replaced the ancient crater. From two\r\n'b'openings in its southern and eastern sides an unceasing flow of lava\r\n'b'poured forth, thus forming two distinct streams. Above the new crater a\r\n'b'cloud of smoke and ashes, mingled with those of the atmosphere, massed\r\n'b'over the island. Loud peals of thunder broke, and could scarcely be\r\n'b'distinguished from the rumblings of the mountain, whose mouth vomited\r\n'b'forth ignited rocks, which, hurled to more than a thousand feet, burst\r\n'b'in the air like shells. Flashes of lightning rivaled in intensity the\r\n'b'volcano\xe2\x80\x99s eruption.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Towards seven in the morning the position was no longer tenable by the\r\n'b'colonists, who accordingly took shelter in the borders of Jacamar Wood.\r\n'b'Not only did the projectiles begin to rain around them, but the lava,\r\n'b'overflowing the bed of Red Creek, threatened to cut off the road to the\r\n'b'corral. The nearest rows of trees caught fire, and their sap, suddenly\r\n'b'transformed into vapor, caused them to explode with loud reports, while\r\n'b'others, less moist, remained unhurt in the midst of the inundation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists had again taken the road to the corral. They proceeded but\r\n'b'slowly, frequently looking back; but, in consequence of the inclination\r\n'b'of the soil, the lava gained rapidly in the east, and as its lower waves\r\n'b'became solidified others, at boiling heat, covered them immediately.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Meanwhile, the principal stream of Red Creek Valley became more and\r\n'b'more menacing. All this portion of the forest was on fire, and enormous\r\n'b'wreaths of smoke rolled over the trees, whose trunks were already\r\n'b'consumed by the lava.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists halted near the lake, about half a mile from the mouth of\r\n'b'Red Creek. A question of life or death was now to be decided.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, accustomed to the consideration of important crises, and\r\n'b'aware that he was addressing men capable of hearing the truth, whatever\r\n'b'it might be, then said,--\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cEither the lake will arrest the progress of the lava, and a part of\r\n'b'the island will be preserved from utter destruction, or the stream will\r\n'b'overrun the forests of the Far West, and not a tree or plant will\r\n'b'remain on the surface of the soil. We shall have no prospect but that\r\n'b'of starvation upon these barren rocks--a death which will probably be\r\n'b'anticipated by the explosion of the island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn that case,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Pencroft, folding his arms and stamping his\r\n'b'foot, \xe2\x80\x9cwhat\xe2\x80\x99s the use of working any longer on the vessel?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cPencroft,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwe must do our duty to the last!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'At this instant the river of lava, after having broken a passage through\r\n'b'the noble trees it devoured in its course, reached the borders of the\r\n'b'lake. At this point there was an elevation of the soil which, had it\r\n'b'been greater, might have sufficed to arrest the torrent.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cTo work!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The engineer\xe2\x80\x99s thought was at once understood. It might be possible to\r\n'b'dam, as it were, the torrent, and thus compel it to pour itself into the\r\n'b'lake.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists hastened to the dockyard. They returned with shovels,\r\n'b'picks, axes, and by means of banking the earth with the aid of fallen\r\n'b'trees they succeeded in a few hours in raising an embankment three feet\r\n'b'high and some hundreds of paces in length. It seemed to them, when\r\n'b'they had finished, as if they had scarcely been working more than a few\r\n'b'minutes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was not a moment too soon. The liquefied substances soon after\r\n'b'reached the bottom of the barrier. The stream of lava swelled like a\r\n'b'river about to overflow its banks, and threatened to demolish the sole\r\n'b'obstacle which could prevent it from overrunning the whole Far West. But\r\n'b'the dam held firm, and after a moment of terrible suspense the torrent\r\n'b'precipitated itself into Grant Lake from a height of twenty feet.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists, without moving or uttering a word, breathlessly regarded\r\n'b'this strife of the two elements.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'What a spectacle was this conflict between water and fire! What pen\r\n'b'could describe the marvelous horror of this scene--what pencil could\r\n'b'depict it? The water hissed as it evaporated by contact with the boiling\r\n'b'lava. The vapor whirled in the air to an immeasurable height, as if\r\n'b'the valves of an immense boiler had been suddenly opened. But, however\r\n'b'considerable might be the volume of water contained in the lake, it must\r\n'b'eventually be absorbed, because it was not replenished, while the stream\r\n'b'of lava, fed from an inexhaustible source, rolled on without ceasing new\r\n'b'waves of incandescent matter.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The first waves of lava which fell in the lake immediately solidified\r\n'b'and accumulated so as speedily to emerge from it. Upon their surface\r\n'b'fell other waves, which in their turn became stone, but a step\r\n'b'nearer the center of the lake. In this manner was formed a pier which\r\n'b'threatened to gradually fill up the lake, which could not overflow, the\r\n'b'water displaced by the lava being evaporated. The hissing of the water\r\n'b'rent the air with a deafening sound, and the vapor, blown by the wind,\r\n'b'fell in rain upon the sea. The pier became longer and longer, and the\r\n'b'blocks of lava piled themselves one on another. Where formerly stretched\r\n'b'the calm waters of the lake now appeared an enormous mass of smoking\r\n'b'rocks, as if an upheaving of the soil had formed immense shoals. Imagine\r\n'b'the waters of the lake aroused by a hurricane, then suddenly solidified\r\n'b'by an intense frost, and some conception may be formed of the aspect of\r\n'b'the lake three hours after the eruption of this irresistible torrent of\r\n'b'lava.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This time water would be vanquished by fire.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Nevertheless it was a fortunate circumstance for the colonists that the\r\n'b'effusion of lava should have been in the direction of Lake Grant. They\r\n'b'had before them some days\xe2\x80\x99 respite. The plateau of Prospect Heights,\r\n'b'Granite House, and the dockyard were for the moment preserved. And these\r\n'b'few days it was necessary to employ in planking and carefully calking\r\n'b'the vessel, and launching her. The colonists would then take refuge on\r\n'b'board the vessel, content to rig her after she should be afloat on the\r\n'b'waters. With the danger of an explosion which threatened to destroy the\r\n'b'island there could be no security on shore. The walls of Granite House,\r\n'b'once so sure a retreat, might at any moment fall in upon them.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the six following days, from the 25th to the 30th of January, the\r\n'b'colonists accomplished as much of the construction of their vessel as\r\n'b'twenty men could have done. They hardly allowed themselves a moment\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'repose, and the glare of the flames which shot from the crater enabled\r\n'b'them to work night and day. The flow of lava continued, but perhaps\r\n'b'less abundantly. This was fortunate, for Lake Grant was almost entirely\r\n'b'choked up, and if more lava should accumulate it would inevitably spread\r\n'b'over the plateau of Prospect Heights, and thence upon the beach.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But if the island was thus partially protected on this side, it was not\r\n'b'so with the western part.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'In fact, the second stream of lava, which had followed the valley of\r\n'b'Falls River, a valley of great extent, the land on both sides of the\r\n'b'creek being flat, met with no obstacle. The burning liquid had then\r\n'b'spread through the forest of the Far West. At this period of the year,\r\n'b'when the trees were dried up by a tropical heat, the forest caught fire\r\n'b'instantaneously, in such a manner that the conflagration extended itself\r\n'b'both by the trunks of the trees and by their higher branches, whose\r\n'b'interlacement favored its progress. It even appeared that the current\r\n'b'of flame spread more rapidly among the summits of the trees than the\r\n'b'current of lava at their bases.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus it happened that the wild animals, jaguars, wild boars, capybaras,\r\n'b'koalas, and game of every kind, mad with terror, had fled to the banks\r\n'b'of the Mercy and to the Tadorn Marsh, beyond the road to Port Balloon.\r\n'b'But the colonists were too much occupied with their task to pay any\r\n'b'attention to even the most formidable of these animals. They had\r\n'b'abandoned Granite House, and would not even take shelter at the\r\n'b'Chimneys, but encamped under a tent, near the mouth of the Mercy.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Each day Cyrus Harding and Gideon Spilett ascended the plateau of\r\n'b'Prospect Heights. Sometimes Herbert accompanied them, but never\r\n'b'Pencroft, who could not bear to look upon the prospect of the island now\r\n'b'so utterly devastated.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was, in truth, a heart-rending spectacle. All the wooded part of the\r\n'b'island was now completely bare. One single clump of green trees raised\r\n'b'their heads at the extremity of Serpentine Peninsula. Here and there\r\n'b'were a few grotesque blackened and branchless stumps. The side of the\r\n'b'devastated forest was even more barren than Tadorn Marsh. The eruption\r\n'b'of lava had been complete. Where formerly sprang up that charming\r\n'b'verdure, the soil was now nothing but a savage mass of volcanic tufa.\r\n'b'In the valleys of the Falls and Mercy rivers no drop of water now\r\n'b'flowed towards the sea, and should Lake Grant be entirely dried up,\r\n'b'the colonists would have no means of quenching their thirst. But,\r\n'b'fortunately the lava had spared the southern corner of the lake,\r\n'b'containing all that remained of the drinking water of the island.\r\n'b'Towards the northwest stood out the rugged and well-defined outlines of\r\n'b'the sides of the volcano, like a gigantic claw hovering over the island.\r\n'b'What a sad and fearful sight, and how painful to the colonists, who,\r\n'b'from a fertile domain covered with forests, irrigated by watercourses,\r\n'b'and enriched by the produce of their toils, found themselves, as it\r\n'b'were, transported to a desolate rock, upon which, but for their reserves\r\n'b'of provisions, they could not even gather the means of subsistence!\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is enough to break one\xe2\x80\x99s heart!\xe2\x80\x9d said Gideon Spilett, one day.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cYes, Spilett,\xe2\x80\x9d answered the engineer. \xe2\x80\x9cMay God grant us the time to\r\n'b'complete this vessel, now our sole refuge!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDo not you think, Cyrus, that the violence of the eruption has somewhat\r\n'b'lessened? The volcano still vomits forth lava, but somewhat less\r\n'b'abundantly, if I mistake not.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt matters little,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding. \xe2\x80\x9cThe fire is still burning\r\n'b'in the interior of the mountain, and the sea may break in at any moment.\r\n'b'We are in the condition of passengers whose ship is devoured by a\r\n'b'conflagration which they cannot extinguish, and who know that sooner or\r\n'b'later the flames must reach the powder-magazine. To work, Spilett, to\r\n'b'work, and let us not lose an hour!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During eight days more, that is to say until the 7th of February,\r\n'b'the lava continued to flow, but the eruption was confined within the\r\n'b'previous limits. Cyrus Harding feared above all lest the liquefied\r\n'b'matter should overflow the shore, for in that event the dockyard could\r\n'b'not escape. Moreover, about this time the colonists felt in the frame of\r\n'b'the island vibrations which alarmed them to the highest degree.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the 20th of February. Yet another month must elapse before the\r\n'b'vessel would be ready for sea. Would the island hold together till then?\r\n'b'The intention of Pencroft and Cyrus Harding was to launch the vessel\r\n'b'as soon as the hull should be complete. The deck, the upperworks, the\r\n'b'interior woodwork and the rigging might be finished afterwards, but the\r\n'b'essential point was that the colonists should have an assured refuge\r\n'b'away from the island. Perhaps it might be even better to conduct the\r\n'b'vessel to Port Balloon, that is to say, as far as possible from the\r\n'b'center of eruption, for at the mouth of the Mercy, between the islet and\r\n'b'the wall of granite, it would run the risk of being crushed in the event\r\n'b'of any convulsion. All the exertions of the voyagers were therefore\r\n'b'concentrated upon the completion of the hull.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Thus the 3rd of March arrived, and they might calculate upon launching\r\n'b'the vessel in ten days.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Hope revived in the hearts of the colonists, who had, in this fourth\r\n'b'year of their sojourn on Lincoln island, suffered so many trials. Even\r\n'b'Pencroft lost in some measure the somber taciturnity occasioned by\r\n'b'the devastation and ruin of his domain. His hopes, it is true, were\r\n'b'concentrated upon his vessel.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWe shall finish it,\xe2\x80\x9d he said to the engineer, \xe2\x80\x9cwe shall finish it,\r\n'b'captain, and it is time, for the season is advancing and the equinox\r\n'b'will soon be here. Well, if necessary, we must put in to Tabor island\r\n'b'to spend the winter. But think of Tabor island after Lincoln Island. Ah,\r\n'b'how unfortunate! Who could have believed it possible?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cLet us get on,\xe2\x80\x9d was the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s invariable reply.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'And they worked away without losing a moment.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMaster,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Neb, a few days later, \xe2\x80\x9cdo you think all this could have\r\n'b'happened if Captain Nemo had been still alive?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCertainly, Neb,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Cyrus Harding.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI, for one, don\xe2\x80\x99t believe it!\xe2\x80\x9d whispered Pencroft to Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cNor I!\xe2\x80\x9d answered Neb seriously.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the first week of March appearances again became menacing.\r\n'b'Thousands of threads like glass, formed of fluid lava, fell like rain\r\n'b'upon the island. The crater was again boiling with lava which overflowed\r\n'b'the back of the volcano. The torrent flowed along the surface of the\r\n'b'hardened tufa, and destroyed the few meager skeletons of trees which had\r\n'b'withstood the first eruption. The stream, flowing this time towards the\r\n'b'southwest shore of Lake Grant, stretched beyond Creek Glycerine, and\r\n'b'invaded the plateau of Prospect Heights. This last blow to the work of\r\n'b'the colonists was terrible. The mill, the buildings of the inner court,\r\n'b'the stables, were all destroyed. The affrighted poultry fled in all\r\n'b'directions. Top and Jup showed signs of the greatest alarm, as if their\r\n'b'instinct warned them of an impending catastrophe. A large number of the\r\n'b'animals of the island had perished in the first eruption. Those which\r\n'b'survived found no refuge but Tadorn Marsh, save a few to which the\r\n'b'plateau of Prospect Heights afforded asylum. But even this last retreat\r\n'b'was now closed to them, and the lava-torrent, flowing over the edge of\r\n'b'the granite wall, began to pour down upon the beach its cataracts of\r\n'b'fire. The sublime horror of this spectacle passed all description.\r\n'b'During the night it could only be compared to a Niagara of molten fluid,\r\n'b'with its incandescent vapors above and its boiling masses below.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists were driven to their last entrenchment, and although the\r\n'b'upper seams of the vessel were not yet calked, they decided to launch\r\n'b'her at once.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Pencroft and Ayrton therefore set about the necessary preparations for\r\n'b'the launching, which was to take place the morning of the next day, the\r\n'b'9th of March.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But during the night of the 8th an enormous column of vapor escaping\r\n'b'from the crater rose with frightful explosions to a height of more than\r\n'b'three thousand feet. The wall of Dakkar Grotto had evidently given way\r\n'b'under the pressure of gases, and the sea, rushing through the central\r\n'b'shaft into the igneous gulf, was at once converted into vapor. But\r\n'b'the crater could not afford a sufficient outlet for this vapor. An\r\n'b'explosion, which might have been heard at a distance of a hundred miles,\r\n'b'shook the air. Fragments of mountains fell into the Pacific, and, in a\r\n'b'few minutes, the ocean rolled over the spot where Lincoln island once\r\n'b'stood.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Chapter 20\r\n'b'\r\n'b'An isolated rock, thirty feet in length, twenty in breadth, scarcely ten\r\n'b'from the water\xe2\x80\x99s edge, such was the only solid point which the waves of\r\n'b'the Pacific had not engulfed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was all that remained of the structure of Granite House! The wall had\r\n'b'fallen headlong and been then shattered to fragments, and a few of the\r\n'b'rocks of the large room were piled one above another to form this point.\r\n'b'All around had disappeared in the abyss; the inferior cone of Mount\r\n'b'Franklin, rent asunder by the explosion; the lava jaws of Shark Gulf,\r\n'b'the plateau of Prospect Heights, Safety Islet, the granite rocks of Port\r\n'b'Balloon, the basalts of Dakkar Grotto, the long Serpentine Peninsula, so\r\n'b'distant nevertheless from the center of the eruption. All that could\r\n'b'now be seen of Lincoln Island was the narrow rock which now served as a\r\n'b'refuge to the six colonists and their dog Top.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The animals had also perished in the catastrophe; the birds, as well\r\n'b'as those representing the fauna of the island--all either crushed or\r\n'b'drowned, and the unfortunate Jup himself had, alas! found his death in\r\n'b'some crevice of the soil.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'If Cyrus Harding, Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Pencroft, Neb, and Ayrton\r\n'b'had survived, it was because, assembled under their tent, they had been\r\n'b'hurled into the sea at the instant when the fragments of the island\r\n'b'rained down on every side.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When they reached the surface they could only perceive, at half a\r\n'b'cable\xe2\x80\x99s length, this mass of rocks, towards which they swam and on which\r\n'b'they found footing.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'On this barren rock they had now existed for nine days. A few provisions\r\n'b'taken from the magazine of Granite House before the catastrophe, a\r\n'b'little fresh water from the rain which had fallen in a hollow of the\r\n'b'rock, was all that the unfortunate colonists possessed. Their last hope,\r\n'b'the vessel, had been shattered to pieces. They had no means of quitting\r\n'b'the reef; no fire, nor any means of obtaining it. It seemed that they\r\n'b'must inevitably perish.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This day, the 18th of March, there remained only provisions for two\r\n'b'days, although they limited their consumption to the bare necessaries\r\n'b'of life. All their science and intelligence could avail them nothing in\r\n'b'their present position. They were in the hand of God.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding was calm, Gideon Spilett more nervous, and Pencroft, a\r\n'b'prey to sullen anger, walked to and fro on the rock. Herbert did not\r\n'b'for a moment quit the engineer\xe2\x80\x99s side, as if demanding from him that\r\n'b'assistance he had no power to give. Neb and Ayrton were resigned to\r\n'b'their fate.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh, what a misfortune! what a misfortune!\xe2\x80\x9d often repeated Pencroft.\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIf we had but a walnut-shell to take us to Tabor Island! But we have\r\n'b'nothing, nothing!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Nemo did right to die,\xe2\x80\x9d said Neb.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'During the five ensuing days Cyrus Harding and his unfortunate\r\n'b'companions husbanded their provisions with the most extreme care, eating\r\n'b'only what would prevent them from dying of starvation. Their weakness\r\n'b'was extreme. Herbert and Neb began to show symptoms of delirium.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Under these circumstances was it possible for them to retain even the\r\n'b'shadow of a hope? No! What was their sole remaining chance? That a\r\n'b'vessel should appear in sight of the rock? But they knew only too well\r\n'b'from experience that no ships ever visited this part of the Pacific.\r\n'b'Could they calculate that, by a truly providential coincidence, the\r\n'b'Scotch yacht would arrive precisely at this time in search of Ayrton\r\n'b'at Tabor Island? It was scarcely probable; and, besides, supposing\r\n'b'she should come there, as the colonists had not been able to deposit\r\n'b'a notice pointing out Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s change of abode, the commander of the\r\n'b'yacht, after having explored Tabor Island without results, would again\r\n'b'set sail and return to lower latitudes.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'No! no hope of being saved could be retained, and a horrible death,\r\n'b'death from hunger and thirst, awaited them upon this rock.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Already they were stretched on the rock, inanimate, and no longer\r\n'b'conscious of what passed around them. Ayrton alone, by a supreme effort,\r\n'b'from time to time raised his head, and cast a despairing glance over the\r\n'b'desert ocean.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'But on the morning of the 24th of March Ayrton\xe2\x80\x99s arms were extended\r\n'b'toward a point in the horizon; he raised himself, at first on his knees,\r\n'b'then upright, and his hand seemed to make a signal.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A sail was in sight off the rock. She was evidently not without an\r\n'b'object. The reef was the mark for which she was making in a direct line,\r\n'b'under all steam, and the unfortunate colonists might have made her out\r\n'b'some hours before if they had had the strength to watch the horizon.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d murmured Ayrton--and fell back without sign of life.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'When Cyrus Harding and his companions recovered consciousness, thanks to\r\n'b'the attention lavished upon them, they found themselves in the cabin of\r\n'b'a steamer, without being able to comprehend how they had escaped death.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A word from Ayrton explained everything.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d he murmured.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cThe \xe2\x80\x98Duncan\xe2\x80\x99!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed Cyrus Harding. And raising his hand to Heaven,\r\n'b'he said, \xe2\x80\x9cOh! Almighty God! mercifully hast Thou preserved us!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was, in fact, the \xe2\x80\x9cDuncan,\xe2\x80\x9d Lord Glenarvan\xe2\x80\x99s yacht, now commanded by\r\n'b'Robert, son of Captain Grant, who had been despatched to Tabor Island to\r\n'b'find Ayrton, and bring him back to his native land after twelve years of\r\n'b'expiation.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists were not only saved, but already on the way to their\r\n'b'native country.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Grant,\xe2\x80\x9d asked Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cwho can have suggested to you the\r\n'b'idea, after having left Tabor Island, where you did not find Ayrton, of\r\n'b'coming a hundred miles farther northeast?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cCaptain Harding,\xe2\x80\x9d replied Robert Grant, \xe2\x80\x9cit was in order to find, not\r\n'b'only Ayrton, but yourself and your companions.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy companions and myself?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cDoubtless, at Lincoln Island.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAt Lincoln Island!\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed in a breath Gideon Spilett, Herbert, Neb,\r\n'b'and Pencroft, in the highest degree astonished.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cHow could you be aware of the existence of Lincoln Island?\xe2\x80\x9d inquired\r\n'b'Cyrus Harding, \xe2\x80\x9cit is not even named in the charts.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI knew of it from a document left by you on Tabor Island,\xe2\x80\x9d answered\r\n'b'Robert Grant.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cA document!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Gideon Spilett.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cWithout doubt, and here it is,\xe2\x80\x9d answered Robert Grant, producing a\r\n'b'paper which indicated the longitude and latitude of Lincoln Island, \xe2\x80\x9cthe\r\n'b'present residence of Ayrton and five American colonists.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIt is Captain Nemo!\xe2\x80\x9d cried Cyrus Harding, after having read the notice,\r\n'b'and recognized that the handwriting was similar to that of the paper\r\n'b'found at the corral.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAh!\xe2\x80\x9d said Pencroft, \xe2\x80\x9cit was then he who took our \xe2\x80\x98Bonadventure\xe2\x80\x99 and\r\n'b'hazarded himself alone to go to Tabor Island!\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cIn order to leave this notice,\xe2\x80\x9d added Herbert.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cI was then right in saying,\xe2\x80\x9d exclaimed the sailor, \xe2\x80\x9cthat even after his\r\n'b'death the captain would render us a last service.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cMy friends,\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, in a voice of the profoundest emotion,\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cmay the God of mercy have had pity on the soul of Captain Nemo, our\r\n'b'benefactor.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The colonists uncovered themselves at these last words of Cyrus Harding,\r\n'b'and murmured the name of Captain Nemo.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Then Ayrton, approaching the engineer, said simply, \xe2\x80\x9cWhere should this\r\n'b'coffer be deposited?\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'It was the coffer which Ayrton had saved at the risk of his life, at\r\n'b'the very instant that the island had been engulfed, and which he now\r\n'b'faithfully handed to the engineer.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\xe2\x80\x9cAyrton! Ayrton!\xe2\x80\x9d said Cyrus Harding, deeply touched. Then, addressing\r\n'b'Robert Grant, \xe2\x80\x9cSir,\xe2\x80\x9d he added, \xe2\x80\x9cyou left behind you a criminal; you find\r\n'b'in his place a man who has become honest by penitence, and whose hand I\r\n'b'am proud to clasp in mine.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Robert Grant was now made acquainted with the strange history of Captain\r\n'b'Nemo and the colonists of Lincoln Island. Then, observation being taken\r\n'b'of what remained of this shoal, which must henceforward figure on the\r\n'b'charts of the Pacific, the order was given to make all sail.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'A few weeks afterwards the colonists landed in America, and found their\r\n'b'country once more at peace after the terrible conflict in which right\r\n'b'and justice had triumphed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Of the treasures contained in the coffer left by Captain Nemo to the\r\n'b'colonists of Lincoln Island, the larger portion was employed in the\r\n'b'purchase of a vast territory in the State of Iowa. One pearl alone, the\r\n'b'finest, was reserved from the treasure and sent to Lady Glenarvan in the\r\n'b'name of the castaways restored to their country by the \xe2\x80\x9cDuncan.\xe2\x80\x9d\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There, upon this domain, the colonists invited to labor, that is to say,\r\n'b'to wealth and happiness, all those to whom they had hoped to offer the\r\n'b'hospitality of Lincoln Island. There was founded a vast colony to\r\n'b'which they gave the name of that island sunk beneath the waters of the\r\n'b'Pacific. A river there was called the Mercy, a mountain took the name\r\n'b'of Mount Franklin, a small lake was named Lake Grant, and the forests\r\n'b'became the forests of the Far West. It might have been an island on\r\n'b'terra firma.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There, under the intelligent hands of the engineer and his companions,\r\n'b'everything prospered. Not one of the former colonists of Lincoln Island\r\n'b'was absent, for they had sworn to live always together. Neb was with his\r\n'b'master; Ayrton was there ready to sacrifice himself for all; Pencroft\r\n'b'was more a farmer than he had ever been a sailor; Herbert, who completed\r\n'b'his studies under the superintendence of Cyrus Harding, and Gideon\r\n'b'Spilett, who founded the New Lincoln Herald, the best-informed journal\r\n'b'in the world.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There Cyrus Harding and his companions received at intervals visits from\r\n'b'Lord and Lady Glenarvan, Captain John Mangles and his wife, the sister\r\n'b'of Robert Grant, Robert Grant himself, Major McNab, and all those who\r\n'b'had taken part in the history both of Captain Grant and Captain Nemo.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'There, to conclude, all were happy, united in the present as they had\r\n'b'been in the past; but never could they forget that island upon which\r\n'b'they had arrived poor and friendless, that island which, during four\r\n'b'years had supplied all their wants, and of which there remained but a\r\n'b'fragment of granite washed by the waves of the Pacific, the tomb of him\r\n'b'who had borne the name of Captain Nemo.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'End of the Project Gutenberg EBook of The Mysterious Island, by Jules Verne\r\n'b'\r\n'b'*** END OF THIS PROJECT GUTENBERG EBOOK THE MYSTERIOUS ISLAND ***\r\n'b'\r\n'b'***** This file should be named 1268-0.txt or 1268-0.zip *****\r\n'b'This and all associated files of various formats will be found in:\r\n'b'        http://www.gutenberg.org/1/2/6/1268/\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Produced by Anthony Matonak, and Trevor Carlson\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Updated editions will replace the previous one--the old editions\r\n'b'will be renamed.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Creating the works from public domain print editions means that no\r\n'b'one owns a United States copyright in these works, so the Foundation\r\n'b'(and you!) can copy and distribute it in the United States without\r\n'b'permission and without paying copyright royalties.

It exists\r\n'b'because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from\r\n'b'people in all walks of life.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the\r\n'b'assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm\xe2\x80\x99s\r\n'b'goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will\r\n'b'remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project\r\n'b'Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure\r\n'b'and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.\r\n'b'To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation\r\n'b'and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4\r\n'b'and the Foundation web page at http://www.pglaf.org.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Section 3.

Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg\r\n'b'Literary Archive Foundation\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide\r\n'b'spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of\r\n'b'increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be\r\n'b'freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest\r\n'b'array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations\r\n'b'($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt\r\n'b'status with the IRS.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating\r\n'b'charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United\r\n'b'States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a\r\n'b'considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up\r\n'b'with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations\r\n'b'where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To\r\n'b'SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any\r\n'b'particular state visit http://pglaf.org\r\n'b'\r\n'b'While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we\r\n'b'have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition\r\n'b'against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who\r\n'b'approach us with offers to donate.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make\r\n'b'any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from\r\n'b'outside the United States.

General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic\r\n'b'works.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm\r\n'b'concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared\r\n'b'with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project\r\n'b'Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed\r\n'b'editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.\r\n'b'unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily\r\n'b'keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.\r\n'b'\r\n'b'\r\n'b'Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:\r\n'b'\r\n'b'     http://www.gutenberg.org\r\n'b'\r\n'b'This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,\r\n'b'including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary\r\n'b'Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to\r\n'b'subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.\r\n'
